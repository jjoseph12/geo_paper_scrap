Cell suspensions were then loaded onto the 10x Genomics Controller for GEM generation.
Library was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (single cell 3’ v2 protocol, 10x Genomics). Briefly, GCs were resuspended in the master mix and loaded together with partitioning oil and gel beads into the chip to generate the gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM). The poly-A RNA from the cell lysate contained in every single GEM was retrotranscripted to cDNA, which contains an Ilumina R1 primer sequence, Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and the 10x Barcode. The pooled barcoded cDNA was then cleaned up with Silane DynaBeads, amplified by PCR and the apropiated sized fragments were selected with SPRIselect reagent for subsequent library construction. During the library construction Ilumina R2 primer sequence, paired-end constructs with P5 and P7 sequences and a sample index were added.

Sections were deparaffinized and incubated overnight with the Whole Transcriptomic Assay UV-cleavable biological probes according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were stained with CONFIRM® anti-EGFR (5B7) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody  (Ventana #790-4347, 1:20 dilution) and anti-HLA-G (4H48) mouse primary antibody (Abcam #ab52455, 1:1000 dilution) for 2 hours followed by secondary staining for 1h with Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit-647 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor anti-mouse-594 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), and SYTO13 (Nanostring, 1:10 dilution) for nuclei staining. Slides were scanned on a GeoMx digital spatial profiler machine r. Based on the morphology markers, areas of interest (AOIs) containing at least EGFR+/HLA-G- 100 nuclei were manually selected.

Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

After the cleanup of the transposed DNA was complete, samples were stored at -20°C until library amplification.
The samples underwent 5 cycles of PCR before an aliquot was used in a quantitative PCR (qPCR) reaction to determine whether additional amplification was required. An Applied Biosciences Viia7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosciences, Beverly Hills, CA) was used for qPCR and the number of additional PCR cycles needed was determined from the multicomponent plot, which plots fluorescence versus the number of PCR cycles. The maximum fluorescence for each sample was found from the plot, ¼ of the maximum fluorescence value was calculated, and the number of additional PCR cycles needed was determined by determining the cycle number that reached ¼ maximum fluorescence on the graph. In cases where the ¼ maximum fluorescence value was halfway between two cycle numbers, the lower number of cycles was selected since slight under-amplification was more favorable than overamplification. The original samples were then PCR amplified with their determined number of additional cycles. Cleanup of the samples was performed after PCR amplification according to the published protocol (Corces et al. 2017). Libraries were quantified using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Q32853, Thermo-Fisher) and the size was determined with a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit (5067-4626, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).

RNA was isolated with a TRIzol/chloroform precipitation followed by a cleanup with a RNeasy Mini Kit (74104, Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Frozen cell isolates in TRIzol were thawed on ice prior to starting the isolation. Once thawed, the samples were placed at room temperature for 5 min to promote dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Next, 200 μL of chloroform was added to each sample with vigorous shaking for 15 sec. Samples were placed at room temperature for 3 min before centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the upper, colorless, aqueous phase was removed and transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol added. Isolates containing ethanol were mixed thoroughly by pipetting and 650 μl transferred to a RNeasy spin column. The protocol for the RNeasy Mini Kit was then followed to clean the sample post-TRIzol/chloroform extraction. RNA was then quantified using a Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit and RNA integrity assessed using RNA ScreenTape (5067-5577 and 5067-5576, Agilent) on the Agilent TapeStation platform (Agilent) prior to library preparation
RNA libraries were prepared using a TruSeq Stranded RNA HT Sample Prep Kit (RS-122-2303, Illuminaon a Caliper Sciclone G3 platform (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) . Manual bead cleanup was performed using AMPure XP Beads (A63881, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) after llibrary preparation to remove primer-dimers. 1.0x volume of beads was added to the entire library volume. Samples were mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before being placed on a magnetic stand until the supernatant cleared. Once clear, the supernatant was removed and discarded, and the beads were washed twice with 80% ethanol while still on the magnet. Any residual ethanol was removed, and the beads were air-dried on the magnet for 5 min at room temperature. Once dry, 30 μL of Resuspension Buffer was added to each sample, the beads were resuspended by pipetting, and the solution incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Samples were then placed on a magnet until the supernatant was clear. The supernatant was then transferred to a new plate. A Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit was used to determine the concentration of the library and a Fragment Analyzer Standard Sensitivity NGS Fragment Kit (DNF-473-10000, Agilent) was used to detect the size of the library and to verify removal of excess primer-dimers. Standard Illumina Free-Adapter Blocking was performed on the libraries.
Cleaned, adapter-blocked libraries were loaded on a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with a run configuration of 151x8x8x151 and an average depth of 70M PE reads per library.

Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using TRIzolreagent (cat no. 15596018, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
The Stranded mRNA-Seq was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing Systemat the University of Kansas Medical Center –Genomics Core (Kansas City, KS). Quality control on RNA submissions was completed using the Agilent TapeStation 4200 using the RNA ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5576). Total RNA (1ug) was used toinitiatethe library preparation protocol.The total RNA fraction was processed by oligo dT bead capture of mRNA, fragmentation, reverse transcriptioninto cDNA, end repair of cDNA, ligation withthe appropriate Unique Dual Index (UDI) adaptors, strand selection and library amplification by PCR using the Universal Plus mRNA-seq with NuQuant library preparation kit (Tecan Genomics 0520-A01).Library validation was performed using the D1000 ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5582) on theAgilent TapeStation 4200. Concentration of each library was determined with the NuQuant module of the library prep kit using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen),Libraries were pooled based on equal molar amounts and the multiplexed pool was quantitated, in triplicate, using the Roche Lightcycler96 withFastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche 06402712001) and KAPA Library Quant (Illumina) DNA Standards 1-6 (KAPA Biosystems KK4903). Using the qPCR results, theRNA-Seq library pool was adjusted to 2.125nM for multiplexed sequencing.Pooled libraries were denatured with 0.2N NaOH (0.04N final concentration) and neutralized with 400mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. A dilution of the pooled libraries to 425 pM is performed in the sample tube, on instrument, followed by onboard clonal clustering of the patterned flow cell using the NovaSeq 6000 S1 Reagent Kit (200 cycle) (Illumina 20012864). A 2x101 cycle sequencing profile with dual index reads is completed using the following sequence profile: Read 1 – 101 cycles x Index Read 1 – 8 cycles x Index Read 2 – 8 cycles x Read 2 – 101 cycles. Following collection, sequence data is converted from .bcl file format to fastq file format using bcl2fastq software and de-multiplexed into individual sequences for data distribution using a secure FTP site or Illumina BaseSpace for further downstream analysis.

ChIP was performed on a hTSC line,TSCT-1 (CT27), established in our previous study (Okae et al. Cell Stem Cell 2018) using the ChIP Reagents (NIPPON GENE).
The ChIP-seq library was constructed using the Ovation Ultralow System V2 (NuGEN) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina).
The puromycin resistant gene (PuroR) and Cas9 were PCR amplified from the pGIPZ vector (Open Biosystems) and Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Expression Plasmid (IDT), respectively. PuroR, a T2A element, and Cas9 were cloned into the CS-CA-MCS plasmid (kindly provided by H. Miyoshi, RIKEN BioResource Center, Ibaraki, Japan) using the In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Takara). The resulting vector was designated as pCS-CA-PuroR-T2A-Cas9. The kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene and the pUC origin were amplified from pCAG-HIVgp (kindly provided by H. Miyoshi), and the human U6 (hU6) promoter was amplified from the pCS-hU6 vector2. The kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene, the pUC origin, the hU6 promoter, 3xFLAG, and a loxP sequence were assembled using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit (NEB). An sgRNA targeting the last exon of SNAI1 (target sequence: 5′-CAC CAA GAG TCC GGC TGC TC-3′), a loxP sequence, and a gRNA target sequence (5′-CCC GAG CAG CCG GAC TCT TGG TG-3′; the PAM sequence is underlined), were inserted between the hU6 promoter and 3xFLAG to generate pU6-sgSNAI1-loxP-FLAG-loxP. The Cre recombinase gene was amplified from the Cre Vector (Santa Cruz) and cloned into the pCS-3G vector2 to generate pCS-3G-Cre. Sequences of the primers used for the vector construction are shown in Supplemental Table. pCS-CA-PuroR-T2A-Cas9 was cotransfected with pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev and pCAG-HIVgp (kindly provided by H. Miyoshi) into 293T cells and lentivirus expressing PuroR-T2A-Cas9 was prepared. The lentivirus was transduced into TSCT-1 cells, and Cas9-expressing cells were selected by 2 mg/ml puromycin for two days. The pU6-sgSNAI1-loxP-FLAG-loxP vector was transfected into the Cas9-expressing TSCT-1 cells using an electroporator (CUY21Vitro-EX; BEX) with the following setting: Poration pulse [125 V, 10 ms]; Driving pulse [20 V, 50 ms, 5 pulses]. After 200 mg/ml G418 selection for 5 days, lentivirus expressing Cre was transduced into the cells to delete the kanamycin/neomycin resistant gene, the hU6 promoter, and the sgRNA sequence. Then, single-cell cloning was performed, and clones with an in-frame insertion of 3xFLAG were identified by Sanger sequencing. This knock-in strategy is based on homology-independent targeted integration3. One of the obtained clones had a homozygous in-frame insertion of 3xFLAG (Supplemental Figure) and was used for ChIP-seq.
ChIP was performed on the clone with 3xFLAG-tagged SNAI1 using the ChIP Reagents (NIPPON GENE) and an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, Clone #M2). Immunoprecipitation was carried out in IP buffer containing 400 mM NaCl instead of 150 mM to reduce the background signal. The sequencing adapters were a mixture of two adapters (Adapter-T and Adapter-C) in equal amounts4. Adapter-T with a 3’-T overhang was prepared by annealing (5’-CTA CAC GAC GCT CTT CCG ATC TT-3’) and (5’-AGA TCG GAA GAG CAC ACG TCT GAA-3’; 5’ phosphorylated). Adapter-C with a 3’-C overhang was prepared by annealing (5’- CTA CAC GAC GCT CTT CCG ATC TC-3’) and (5’-AGA TCG GAA GAG CAC ACG TCT GAA-3’; 5’ phosphorylated). Adapter-C was added to increase the ligation efficiency. The ChIP-seq library was constructed using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina).

ChIP was performed on CT27 human TS cells in three replicates using the SimpleChiP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-rabbit AP-2 gamma antibody (1:50, 2320, Cell Signaling) was used in the analysis.
In total of 100 ng of fragmented DNA in 25 µL of water was used as input in library preparation. A KAPA HyperPrep Kit (07962347001, Roche) was used for library preparation, following the protocol associated with the kit with the following modifications. During end repair and a-tailing, 35 µL of water was added to the master mix containing 7 µL of end-repair and a-tailing buffer and 3 µL of end-repair and a-tailing enzyme. Forty-five µL of the end-repair and a-tailing master mix was added to each sample and was mixed thoroughly by pipetting. During the adapter ligation step, Illumina TruSeq DNA LT adapters, supplied at 15 µM, were diluted 1:100 in water and 5 µL of diluted adapters were added to the sample. A master mix of 30 µL of ligation buffer and 10 µL of DNA ligase was made and 40 µL of ligation master mix was added to each sample. After adapter ligation, a 0.8x bead clean-up was performed using AMPure XP Beads (A63881, Beckman Coulter) with a 10 min incubation at room temperature to allow the DNA to bind to the beads and a 7 min incubation after two 80% ethanol washes to allow the beads to dry. Once the beads were dry, the beads were resuspended in 25 µL of water and incubated at room temperature for 2 min. Twenty µL of post-ligation sample was then transferred to a new tube to be used in library amplification. The PCR library amplification master mix consisted of 25 µL of 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, 1.5 µL of 10x PCR primer cocktail, and 3.5 µL of water. Thirty µL of the PCR master mix was added to each post-ligation sample and 13 cycles of PCR were performed. After library amplification, the library underwent a 0.6/0.8x double-sized size selection with 10 min incubations to allow the library to bind to the beads. Two 80% ethanol washes were performed, and the beads were allowed to dry at room temperature for 2 min. Thirty-six µL of water was added to the dried beads and was incubated at room temperature for 2 min to elute the DNA.

Cells were rinsed with 5 mL of PBS and then 5 mL PBS containing 2% formaldehyde were added and incubated for 10 min. Then, 550 μL of glycine 1.25 M (final conc 0.125M) were added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature before an additional 15 min incubation on ice. Liquid was removed and cells were rinsed two times with 5 mL ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped and transferred into 2 mL low bind tubes to have the equivalent of 1*10^6 cells (1 Petri Dish). Nuclei were pelleted at 2,500 rpm for 10 min at 4˚C (repeat if necessary) and all supernatant was removed, and flash frozen on dry ice and stored at -80˚C until ready for use. Crosslinked samples were thawed on ice and prepared for Hi-C using the Arima-HiC kit (Arima Genomics, San Diego, CA). Cross-linking was performed according to the Arima-HiC protocol with the following modifications. At step 5, the incubation at 37°C was increased to a duration of 60 min and the samples were maintained overnight at 4°C after step 11. Samples were then cleaned with AMPure XP Beads as described in the protocol and all quantification and quality control steps that required the use of a Qubit were performed using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit. Proximally ligated DNA (1000 ng/sample) was used as an input into the library preparation protocol. Samples were sheared to 400 bp using a Covaris LE220-plus system using the manufacturer’s recommended settings. Sizing was confirmed using a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer kit. Size-selection as described in the Arima-HiC protocol was followed and the entire size-selected sample was used as input into biotin enrichment and library preparation with a KAPA HyperPrep kit and Roche SeqCap Adapters (7141530001 or 7141548001, Roche). Instead of performing the Arima-HiC quality control step 2, the number of cycles needed for library amplification was determined as follows: perform 10 PCR cycles for 125-200 ng of input, perform 9 PCR cycles for 200-400 ng of input, perform 8 PCR cycles for 400-600 ng of input, and perform 7 cycles of PCR for inputs greater than 600 ng. The completed libraries were then quantified using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit and the library size was determined with a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit. Standard Illumina Free-Adapter Blocking was performed on the libraries. Cleaned, adapter-blocked libraries were loaded on a NovaSeq6000 with a run configuration of 151x8x8x151 and an average depth of 900M PE reads per library.",ATAC-seq; RNA-Seq; ChIP-Seq; Hi-C,genomic; transcriptomic,other; cDNA; ChIP,Illumina NovaSeq 6000; Illumina HiSeq 2500,Refer to individual Series,"PhiX  reads were removed using HTStream's (Version 1.3.2) hts_SeqScreener with default parameters.

ATAC-Seq library preparation was performed as previously described (Buenrostro et al., 2013). After nuclei isolation, nuclei were then transposed for 30 min at 37C with adaptor-loaded Nextera Tn5 (Illumina, Fc-121-1030). Transposed fragments were directly PCR amplified and Sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform to generate 2 x 36-bp paired-end reads.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as previously described (Mendenhall et al., 2013). Briefly, cells from two biological replicates per line were fixed for 10min at RT with a final formaldehyde concentration of 0.8%. Formaldehyde was quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 125mM. The cells were then lysed with lysis buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 300mM NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2%v sodium deoxycholate and 10mM Cacl2) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche, 11873580001) for 20min on ice. The chromatin was digested by adding MNase (Thermo Scientific, 88216) for 20min at 37C and MNase was inactivated by adding 20mM EGTA. The fragmented chromatin was added to pre-bounded Dynabeads (A and G mix, Invitrogen, 10004D/ 10002D) using H3K4me2 antibody (Millipore, 07-030) at 2 ug per reaction. Samples were then washed twice with RIPA buffer, twice with RIPA high salt buffer (NaCl 360mM), twice with LiCl wash buffer (10mM Tris-Hcl, 250mM LiCl, 0.5% DOC, 1mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL) and twice with 10mM Tris-HCl pH = 8. DNA was purified by adding RNase A (Thermo Scientific, EN0531) and incubated for 30 min at 37C and then with Proteinase K (Invitrogen, 25530049) for 2h. The DNA was eluted by adding 2X concentrated elution buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, 300mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 2mM EDTA) and reverse crosslinked overnight at 65C. The DNA was then extracted using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, A63881).
ChIP sample libraries were prepared according to Illumina Genomic DNA protocol.

Total RNA was isolated using the Macherey-Nagel RNA NucleoSpin kit (Ornat)
mRNA libraries were prepared using the SENSE mRNA-seq library prep kit V2 (Lexogen)

DNA was isolated from samples and incubated in lysis buffer (25mM Tris-HCl at pH8, 2mM EDTA, 0.2%SDS, 200mM NaCl) supplemented with 300μg/mL proteinase K (Roche) followed by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. hiTSC colonies and hbdTSC colonies were passaged twice on matrigel in order to eliminate the presence of MEF feeder cells.

Single cell suspensions were filtered through a 40µm cell strainer, centrifuged at 200 rcf for 5 min., resuspended in PBS with 0.04% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), and counted with a Luna-FL automated Fluorescence Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems). 100 000 – 1 000 000 cells were added to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube and were centrifuged (300 rcf, 5min at 4°C). Supernatant was removed without disrupting the cell pellet and 100µl chilled lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 Substitute, 0.01% digitonin and 1% BSA) was added and mixed by pipetting 10 times. The microcentrifuge tube was incubated on ice for 4 min and then 1ml chilled wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20 and 1% BSA) was added and mixed by pipetting 5 times. Nuclei were centrifuged (500 rcf, 5 min at 4°C) and the supernatant was removed without disrupting the nuclei pellet. Nuclei were resuspended in a chilled Diluted Nuclei Buffer (10x Genomics; 2000153) at 610-1540 nuclei per µl based on the starting number of cells. The nuclei concentration was determined using a NucleoCounter NC-100 (Chemometec). Nuclei were mixed using the following ratio (H9 primed: Sigma primed: H9 naive: Sigma naive: Sigma TSCs = 1:1:1:1:2) and were immediately used to generate scATAC-seq libraries as described in the methods below.
scATAC-seq libraries were prepared according to the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits User Guide (10x user guide; CG000168, Revision D). Nuclei were loaded onto the 10x Chromium Single Cell Platform (10x Genomics) at a concentration targeting 2000 nuclei, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclei transposition, generation of gel beads in emulsion (GEMs), barcoding, GEM cleanup, and library construction were performed with the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits (v1 Chemistry) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Library Quality control and quantification was assessed using the Tapestation (Agilent) and Qubit 2.0 (ThermoFisher Scientific). The Library was sequenced on a Nextseq500 (Illumina) instrument using the MID output kit (Illumina) (20024904).

Cells were washed with 1X PBS before dissociation from the culture dish by TryplETM Express Enzyme (ThermoFisher, 12605-036) incubation for 8 minutes at 37°C. Single cell suspension was filtered through a Falcon 40 µm Cell Strainer and centrifuged at 200G for 5 min. After resuspension in 1X PBS with 0.04% BSA, the single cell suspension was counted with a Luna-FL automated Fluorescence Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems). TSCs were mixed with primed and naive hPSCs using the following ratio (H9 primed: Sigma primed: H9 naive: Sigma naive: Sigma TSCs = 1:1:1:1:2)
Cells were loaded onto the 10X Chromium Single Cell Platform (10X Genomics) targeting 2000 cells (Next GEM Single Cell 3’ library and Gel Bead Kit v3.1) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x User Guide; CG000204, Revision D). Generation of gel beads in emulsion (GEMs), barcoding, GEM-RT cleanup, complementary DNA amplification and library construction were all performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Individual sample quality was assessed using a Tapestation (Agilent). Qubit 2.0 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Platform (KAPA Biosystems) were used for library quantification before pooling. The final library pool was sequenced on the NovaSeq6000 (Illumina) instrument using NovaSeq SP kit (Illumina) for 2 lanes of 100-base-pair paired-end reads.",ATAC-seq; RNA-Seq,genomic; transcriptomic; transcriptomic single cell,other; cDNA,Illumina NextSeq 500; Illumina NovaSeq 6000,Refer to individual Series,"Preprocessing of single-cell chromatin accessibility data was performed using the cellranger-atac pipeline (10X Genomics).
Read filtering, alignment, cell and peak calling, as well as cell-by-peak count matrix generation were performed using the “count” option (cellranger-atac count) with default parameters.
Downstream analysis was performed using Signac (Stuart et al. 2021). The count matrix was filtered for cells where at least 15% of all fragments fell within peaks, cells with less than 5% of fragments falling within blacklist regions, cells with less than 4% nucleosome signal, cells with greater than 2% enrichment for transcription start sites, and peaks with a minimum of 2500 fragments and a maximum of 20000 fragments.
Cell clusters were identified using the FindNeighbors function with parameters “reduction = ‘lsi’, dims = 2:30’ and FindClusters function with parameters “algorithm = 3, resolution = 0.5”. Upon initial clustering, cluster-specific peaks were called with MACS2 using the function CallPeaks with parameters “group.by = ‘idents’”. These peaks were used to generate a final SIGNAC object which was used for all downstream analyses.
Fragment counts were mapped to peaks using FeatureMatrix with parameters “process_n = 2000”.
Filtering and clustering were performed on the new object as described above. Peaks were then filtered for mean accessibility, keeping all peaks with greater than 0.1 mean accessibility across cells.

Raw sequence reads were quality-checked using the FastQC software. The CellRanger version 4.0.0 was used to process, align and summarize unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts against the 10X Genomics pre-built human GRCh38 and mouse mm10 reference genome dataset (2020-A, July 7, 2020). Downstream analyses were performed on R using Seurat (v4.0.1) (Satija et al. 2015). Human cells were retained and mouse cells (MEFs) were filtered out by adjusting the number of counts per cell (nCount_RNA) and the number of mapped genes per cell (nFeature_RNA) to only keep cells that were mostly mapped to the human GRCh38 (hg38) genome. Cells with more than 25% of mitochondrial counts were filtered out. Count matrix was normalised with Seurat global-scaling normalization method “LogNormalize'' that normalizes the feature expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, multiplies this by a 10000 scale factor, and log-transforms the result.

All mice were on a 14-hour/10-hour light/dark cycle at 30-70 % humidity, 22°C ± 4°C. 5-week-old C57Bl/6J (B) female mice were exposed for 5 weeks to 0, 1, or 50 ppm CdCl2 through drinking water (Sigma-Aldrich, 202908). At 10 weeks B mice were mated with unexposed CAST/EiJ (C) males. Cd exposure continued throughout mating and gestation. Embryos and placentae were dissected at e18.5; collected tissues were weighed, snap-frozen immediately upon dissection and stored at -80°C. Genomic DNA was isolated from four female 0 ppm and four female 50 ppm exposed placentae using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA kit (Qiagen). 100 ng of gDNA was digested with TaqaI (NEB) at 65⁰C for 2 hours followed by MspI (NEB) at 37⁰C overnight. Following enzymatic digestion, samples were used for library generation using the Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System (Tecan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, digested DNA was randomly ligated, and, following fragment end repair, bisulfite converted using the EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen) following the Qiagen protocol. After conversion and clean-up, samples were amplified resuming the Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System protocol for library amplification and purification. Libraries were measured using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation System and quantified using the KAPA Library Quant Kit ABI Prism qPCR Mix (Roche). Libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 550 using single end 75 bp sequencing.","Illumina adapter reads were trimmed using Trim Galore! and a custom script was used to trim additional bases added during library creation to facilitate sequencing. Reads were mapped to the genome using Bismark and Bowtie 2 allowing for no mismatches. Following alignment, PCR duplicates were removed using a custom script. Each unique read had a randomized 6-mer barcode and if more than one read had the same start and end coordinates and the same barcode, all but one of the reads were discarded. Methylation at CpG sites were extracted using Bismark and CpG sites covered by at least 10 reads were analyzed using the methylKit R package. Differentially methylated bases and regions were identified using a Fisher’s exact test for pairwise comparisons and a Chi-squared test for analyses with more than two groups.

The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions.
