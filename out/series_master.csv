Pelleted cells were lysed and then directly transposed using the TDE1 DNA Enzyme and Buffer kit (Illumina, CA, US). The transposition reaction was completed with thermomixing at 37°C for 30 minutes at 300 rpm. Transposed DNA was purified with MinElute column cleanup (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
Prepared libraries were purified with MinElute column clean-up (Qiagen). The ATAC-seq library pool was quantified on the Agilent Bioanalyzer with the High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies, 4067-4626). Sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq500 (NextSeq control software v4.0.0 / Real Time Analysis v2.11.3). The library pool was diluted and denatured according to the standard NextSeq protocol (Document # 15048776 v16) and sequenced to generate paired-end 76 bp reads using a 150 cycle NextSeq500/550 Mid Output reagent Kit v2.5 (Illumina, 20024904). After sequencing, fastq files were generated using bcl2fastq2 (v2.20.0.422).

Samtools (version 1.9) and Picard were used to filter duplicates, remove reads with mapping quality < 30, unmapped reads, reads aligning to the mitochondrial chromosome and unplaced contigs. Quality of library enrichment was evaluated using ENCODE metrics, including Transcription Start Site signal > 10, and sample concordance examined using clustering analysis. Peaks were called for each sample using MACS2 (version 2.1.2), with parameters“-p 0.01–-nomodel–-shift 0–-extsize 14”. Differentially accessible regions between treated and untreated samples were called using DiffBind version 2.14.0, where treatment-dependent peaks were selected as those exhibiting a log fold change > 1. Over-represented transcription factor binding motifs within ATAC-seq peaks were identified using HOMER version 4.8. We also employed a permutation-based strategy using ENCODE dNase-seq footprinting data

Read sequences in compressed (gzipped) FASTQ files were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38) in the Rsubread (v2.8.0) package. The alignment produces a BAM file for each library. The featureCounts function of Rsubread takes all the BAM files and produces the gene count matrix. Each sample is a separate column and each row is a gene. Entrez Gene ID was converted to gene symbol using biomaRt (v 2.56.1) package. Gene counts were TMM normalised in the edgeR package (version 3.42.4) for downstream analysis.

Samples were agitated by pipetting every 5 minutes for 10-20 minutes until dissociated. Enzymatic activity was inactivated through addition of 20% FBS in PBS at 2x volume. Cells were collected in a falcon tube, pelleted, and resuspended in freeze buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris at pH 8.0 (15-567-027, Fisher Scientific), 25% glycerol (G5516, Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM Mg(OAc)2 (63052, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1mM EDTA (15575020, ThermoFisher Scientific), 5mM DTT (R0861, ThermoFisher Scientific), 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma-Aldrich), 1:2500 dilution of superasin (AM2694, Invitrogen). For cell lines, 10,000 cells were counted, pelleted, resuspended in the freeze media above, snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80*C. For nuclei isolation and library construction, low input nuclei isolation protocol from 10x Genomics was performed. Briefly, frozen cell pellets were thawed in a 37°C water bath for 30 seconds, centrifuged (500g for 5 minutes at 4°C) to pellet the cells then the supernatant were aspirated. The cell pellets were washed with 200 ul 1x PBS with 0.04% BSA twice, centrifuged and aspirating the supernatant in between washes. Then, chilled lysis buffer (45 ul per sample) was added to the washed cell pellet and placed on ice for 3 minutes, then wash buffer (50 ul per sample) was added.
Washed isolated nuclei were resuspended in a diluted nuclei buffer. In this study, the isolated nuclei were resuspended in 5 ul of diluted nuclei buffer and were directly added to the transposition reaction. All the steps proceeding, 10x Genomics’ Single Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene expression protocol were followed to manufacturer’s specifications and guidelines.
The final libraries were loaded on the NextSeq 2000 using P2 100 cycle kit at 650 pM loading concentration with paired end sequencing following the recommended sequencing reads from 10x Genomics (28/10/10/90 cycles for gene expression libraries and 50/8/24/49 cycles for ATAC libraries).",RNA-Seq; ATAC-seq,transcriptomic single cell; genomic single cell,cDNA; other,NextSeq 2000,single cell 10x multiome (RNA+ATAC) sequencing on transgene-directed human embryo models.,"Raw reads were analyzed using the CellRangerARC pipeline to generate ATAC and RNA fastq files for each sample, and then to align genomic and transcriptomic reads. Matrices were then read into Seurat and Signac using the Read10X_h5 command. For ATAC-seq data, peaks from standard chromosomes were used and peaks were additionally called using macs2 to add an additional Signac assay. Cells with >500 RNA UMI counts, <20% mitochondrial reads, >500 ATAC reads, TSS enrichment >1 and were called as singlets using scDblFinder were retained for downstream analysis. For UMAP projections, SCTransform was used for RNA counts with percent mitochondrial counts and cell cycle scores regressed. PCA and LSI graphs were used to generate a weighted nearest neighbor (wnn) embedding which accounts for both modalities. chromVAR was run to calculate motif accessibility score on the peaks assay.

Nuclei were centrifuged (500 rcf, 5 min at 4°C) and the supernatant was removed without disrupting the nuclei pellet. Nuclei were resuspended in a chilled Diluted Nuclei Buffer (10x Genomics; 2000153) at 610-1540 nuclei per µl based on the starting number of cells. The nuclei concentration was determined using a NucleoCounter NC-100 (Chemometec). Nuclei were mixed using the following ratio (H9 primed: Sigma primed: H9 naive: Sigma naive: Sigma TSCs = 1:1:1:1:2) and were immediately used to generate scATAC-seq libraries as described in the methods below.
scATAC-seq libraries were prepared according to the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits User Guide (10x user guide; CG000168, Revision D). Nuclei were loaded onto the 10x Chromium Single Cell Platform (10x Genomics) at a concentration targeting 2000 nuclei, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclei transposition, generation of gel beads in emulsion (GEMs), barcoding, GEM cleanup, and library construction were performed with the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits (v1 Chemistry) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Library Quality control and quantification was assessed using the Tapestation (Agilent) and Qubit 2.0 (ThermoFisher Scientific). The Library was sequenced on a Nextseq500 (Illumina) instrument using the MID output kit (Illumina) (20024904).

Read filtering, alignment, cell and peak calling, as well as cell-by-peak count matrix generation were performed using the “count” option (cellranger-atac count) with default parameters.
Downstream analysis was performed using Signac (Stuart et al. 2021). The count matrix was filtered for cells where at least 15% of all fragments fell within peaks, cells with less than 5% of fragments falling within blacklist regions, cells with less than 4% nucleosome signal, cells with greater than 2% enrichment for transcription start sites, and peaks with a minimum of 2500 fragments and a maximum of 20000 fragments.
Cell clusters were identified using the FindNeighbors function with parameters “reduction = ‘lsi’, dims = 2:30’ and FindClusters function with parameters “algorithm = 3, resolution = 0.5”. Upon initial clustering, cluster-specific peaks were called with MACS2 using the function CallPeaks with parameters “group.by = ‘idents’”. These peaks were used to generate a final SIGNAC object which was used for all downstream analyses.
Fragment counts were mapped to peaks using FeatureMatrix with parameters “process_n = 2000”.
Filtering and clustering were performed on the new object as described above. Peaks were then filtered for mean accessibility, keeping all peaks with greater than 0.1 mean accessibility across cells.

The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
