 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.

We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.
RRBS and RNAseq library construction protocol -- Genomic DNA of placenta and umbilical cord blood specimens were extracted by using the TIANamp genomic DNA kit (Cat. No. DP304-02, TIANGEN Biotech CO. LTD., Beijing, China) per the manufacture’s recommendations. 50-300 ng of purified genomic DNA was utilized to generate RRBS libraries as previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0046-4). Indexed RRBS libraries were pooled accordingly and sequenced in a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, USA) with 100-base paired-end reads. Similarly, total RNAs were isolated using a miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacture’s recommendations. We used the Ribo-off rRNA depletion kit (Cat. No. N406-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) to remove ribosomal RNA from total RNAs following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

 Within 15 min after delivery, 5 ml of neonatal umbilical cord blood was collected using two PAXGenRNA sampling tubes (2.5 ml/tube), and collected samples were were stored at -80 ℃. The placental tissues were collected from both the maternal and fetal side. Specifically, using a clean scalpel, one full-thick placental tissue was incised 5 cm from the perimeter of the placenta (a size of about 1×1×2 cm, including maternal and fetal side). Then, the tissues were rinsed with phosphate buffer (PBS) or normal saline until no visible blood and stored at -80 ℃ in a cryopreservation tube. DNA or RNA was extracted after homogenizing the tissues together.

To generate RNA-seq libraries, 10-100 ng rRNA-depleted RNAs were utilized by using the VAHTS total RNA-seq (H/M/R) library prep kit for Illumina (Cat. No. NR603-01, Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) per the manufacturer’s instructions. We sequenced the RNA-seq libraries in the NovoSeq 6000 sequencer with 100-base paired-end reads. The sequencing data volume of a single sample is around 8 gigabases (Gb) and the average sequencing depth of the target region of the enzyme digestion fragment is &gt; 30×, the coverage proportion of CpG region is &gt; 40%, and the total data volume is 100 Gb. Similarly, transcriptome profile for each placenta and umbilical cord blood sample was also conducted. VAHTSTM Total RNA-seq (H/M/R) Library Prep Kit for Illumina® based on Ribo-zero method was used to constructed transcriptome RNA library and high-throughput sequencing was performed subsequently. 10 Gb volume of transcriptome data for each sample was necessary.

    <Summary>
Objective: To explore the characteristics and underlying molecular mechanisms of genome-scale expression profiles of women with- or without- gestational diabetes mellitus and their offspring.  Materials and Methods: We recruited a group of 21 pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 20 healthy pregnant women as controls. For each pregnant women, RRBS were performed using the placenta and paired neonatal umbilical cord blood specimens. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified. Then, functional enrichment analysis was performed to differential methylated genes (DMGs) separately or interactively in placenta and umbilical cord blood.  Results: Through the comparison of GDM and healthy samples, 2779  and 141 DMRs were identified from placenta and umbilical cord blood, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the placenta methylation and expression profiles of GDM women mirrored the molecular characteristics of “type II diabetes” and “insulin resistance”. Methylation-altered genes in umbilical cord blood were associated with pathways “type II diabetes” and “cholesterol metabolism”. DMGs illustrated significant overlaps among placenta and umbilical cord blood samples, and the overlapping DMGs were associated with cholesterol metabolism.  Conclusions: Our research demonstrated the epigenomic alternations of GDM mothers and offspring. Our findings emphasized the importance of epigenetic modifications in the communication between pregnant women with GDM and offspring, and provided reference for the prevention, control, treatment, and intervention of perinatal deleterious events of GDM and neonatal complications.
