Female mice were exposed  with SRM1649b particle (resuspend in sterile PBS and sonicated to obtain a concentration of 15μg/µl) intranasally either starting from 2months prior to gestation followed by 18th day of gestation.

      <Extract-Protocol>
RNA was extracted from D19 placenta of  CON or Air Pollution particle exposed mice with Dirct Zol RNA MiniPrep kit from Zymo following manufacturer's protocol.
Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the KAPA Stranded mRNA sequencing kit (# KK8420; Kapa Biosystem, Cape Town, South Africa). Briefly,100ng of total RNA from each sample was used as the starting material with quadruplicate biological replicate from each group. mRNA was captured using magnetic oligo-dT, fragmented by heat and Mg and reverse transcribed to cDNA using random primers. After 2nd strand synthesis, cDNA was then end-repaired, index adapter-ligated and PCR amplified. SPRIselect beads (# B23318, Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used to purify nucleic acids after each step of the library preparation. RNA sequencing libraries were sequenced by the HiSeq-4000 (Illumina Inc.; San Diego, CA, USA).

RNA was extracted from D19 placenta of  CON or Air Pollution particle exposed mice with Dirct Zol RNA MiniPrep kit from Zymo following manufacturer's protocol.
Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the KAPA Stranded mRNA sequencing kit (# KK8420; Kapa Biosystem, Cape Town, South Africa). Briefly,100ng of total RNA from each sample was used as the starting material with quadruplicate biological replicate from each group. mRNA was captured using magnetic oligo-dT, fragmented by heat and Mg and reverse transcribed to cDNA using random primers. After 2nd strand synthesis, cDNA was then end-repaired, index adapter-ligated and PCR amplified. SPRIselect beads (# B23318, Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used to purify nucleic acids after each step of the library preparation. RNA sequencing libraries were sequenced by the HiSeq-4000 (Illumina Inc.; San Diego, CA, USA).

      <Extract-Protocol>
RNA was extracted from D19 placenta of  CON or Air Pollution particle exposed mice with Dirct Zol RNA MiniPrep kit from Zymo following manufacturer's protocol.
Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the KAPA Stranded mRNA sequencing kit (# KK8420; Kapa Biosystem, Cape Town, South Africa). Briefly,100ng of total RNA from each sample was used as the starting material with quadruplicate biological replicate from each group. mRNA was captured using magnetic oligo-dT, fragmented by heat and Mg and reverse transcribed to cDNA using random primers. After 2nd strand synthesis, cDNA was then end-repaired, index adapter-ligated and PCR amplified. SPRIselect beads (# B23318, Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used to purify nucleic acids after each step of the library preparation. RNA sequencing libraries were sequenced by the HiSeq-4000 (Illumina Inc.; San Diego, CA, USA).

For scRNA-seq library prep, single suspension of each placental compartment was prepared separately by enzymatic digestion of the tissue followed by passing the cell suspension through 100μm cell strainer (MACS, Smart Steiner)
Single-cell RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit (P/N 1000075, 10x Genomics) following manufacturer’s instructions. scRNA sequencing libraries were sequenced by the NovaSeq-6000  (Illumina Inc.; San Diego, CA, USA).

    <Data-Processing>
Demultiplexed fastq files were processed using cellranger count against the mm10 referece, to obtain single cell feature counts.
Cellranger count output files were aggregated using the cellranger aggr
Output from cellranger aggr has been used to create a Seurat object and a standard Seurat pipeline was used for downstream analysis.
