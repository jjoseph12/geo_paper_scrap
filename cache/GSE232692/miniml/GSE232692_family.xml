For differentiation, 70% confluent stem cells were rinsed with DPBS (Gibco) and pre-warmed Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies) was added to the wells. Cells were then placed at 37°C for 5-7 min, after which they were added to an equal volume of fresh media and spun down at 200xg for 5 min. The cells were then resuspended and seeded on Matrigel- or Cultrex-coated plates at 6,000 cells/cm2 in TeSR-E8 or mTeSR Plus with 5 µM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, STEMCELL Technologies). Cells were maintained in E8 or mTeSR Plus for two more days, and then the medium was changed to unconditioned medium (UM): DMEM/F12 with 20% Knockout serum replacement (KOSR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1x), GlutaMAX (1x, Gibco), and 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), containing 1 µM retinoic acid (RA, Sigma) and 8 µM CHIR 99021 (CHIR, Tocris). Cell culture media was changed daily for five days.

Cell pellets were collected and lysed using QiaShredder columns (Qiagen). RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as the manufacturer recommends, including incubation with DNase I (RNAse-free DNase Set, Qiagen).
RNA libraries for RNA-seq were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA (Illumina).

Reads were trimmed for low quality and adaptors using Trimmomatic.
Sequences were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38.91) using STAR.
Cfflinks was used to obtain fragments per kilobase of transcript per million (FPKM) files which were converted to transcripts per million (TPM) files.

For differentiation, 70% confluent stem cells were rinsed with DPBS (Gibco) and pre-warmed Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies) was added to the wells. Cells were then placed at 37°C for 5-7 min, after which they were added to an equal volume of fresh media and spun down at 200xg for 5 min. The cells were then resuspended and seeded on Matrigel- or Cultrex-coated plates at 6,000 cells/cm2 in TeSR-E8 or mTeSR Plus with 5 µM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, STEMCELL Technologies). Cells were maintained in E8 or mTeSR Plus for two more days, and then the medium was changed to unconditioned medium (UM): DMEM/F12 with 20% Knockout serum replacement (KOSR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1x), GlutaMAX (1x, Gibco), and 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), containing 1 µM retinoic acid (RA, Sigma) and 8 µM CHIR 99021 (CHIR, Tocris). Cell culture media was changed daily for five days.

    <Title>Rapid retinoic acid-induced trophectoderm model from human induced pluripotent stem cells</Title>

    <Summary>
A limited number of accessible and representative models of human trophoblast cells currently exist for disease modeling and improving our understanding of placentation. Current stem cell models involve either a transition through a naïve stem cell fate or precise dynamic control of multiple interacting growth factor and small molecule cues. Here, we show that simple exposure of hiPSCs to two small molecules, retinoic acid (RA) and the Wnt signaling agonist CHIR 99021 (CHIR), results in rapid, synergistic upregulation of CDX2, an important transcription factor for trophectoderm cell induction and maintenance of the trophoblast cell population. RA+CHIR-treated cells have a transcriptional profile with high similarity to that of primary trophectoderm cells, and they can also be further differentiated into cells with features of syncytiotrophoblasts and extravillous trophoblasts. We assessed RA+CHIR-treated cells for the established set of criteria defining a trophectoderm cell model, and the cells possess all of the features necessary to be considered a valid model. Taken together, our data demonstrate the development of a simple method for the generation of functional trophoblast-like cells that can be used to better understand mechanisms and interactions involving the placenta.
