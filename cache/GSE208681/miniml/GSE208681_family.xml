    <Data-Processing>
Samples were analyzed using UTAP software (Kohen et al. 2019). Reads were trimmed using CutAdapt (Martin 2011) (parameters: -a ADAPTER1 -a “A{10}” -a “T{10}” -A “A{10}” -A “T{10}” –times 2 -u 3 -u -3 -q 20 -m 25).
Reads were mapped to genome mm10 using STAR (Dobin et al. 2013) v2.4.2a (parameters: –alignEndsType EndToEnd, –outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.05, –twopassMode Basic - alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds No).
Sample counting was done using STAR, quantifying mm10 RefSeq annotated genes. Further analysis was done for genes having a minimum of five reads in at least one sample. Normalization of the counts and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) with the parameters betaPrior = true, cooksCutoff = false, and independentFiltering = false.

    <Data-Processing>
Samples were analyzed using UTAP software (Kohen et al. 2019). Reads were trimmed using CutAdapt (Martin 2011) (parameters: -a ADAPTER1 -a “A{10}” -a “T{10}” -A “A{10}” -A “T{10}” –times 2 -u 3 -u -3 -q 20 -m 25).
Reads were mapped to genome mm10 using STAR (Dobin et al. 2013) v2.4.2a (parameters: –alignEndsType EndToEnd, –outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.05, –twopassMode Basic - alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds No).
Sample counting was done using STAR, quantifying mm10 RefSeq annotated genes. Further analysis was done for genes having a minimum of five reads in at least one sample. Normalization of the counts and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) with the parameters betaPrior = true, cooksCutoff = false, and independentFiltering = false.

    <Data-Processing>
Samples were analyzed using UTAP software (Kohen et al. 2019). Reads were trimmed using CutAdapt (Martin 2011) (parameters: -a ADAPTER1 -a “A{10}” -a “T{10}” -A “A{10}” -A “T{10}” –times 2 -u 3 -u -3 -q 20 -m 25).
Reads were mapped to genome mm10 using STAR (Dobin et al. 2013) v2.4.2a (parameters: –alignEndsType EndToEnd, –outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.05, –twopassMode Basic - alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds No).
Sample counting was done using STAR, quantifying mm10 RefSeq annotated genes. Further analysis was done for genes having a minimum of five reads in at least one sample. Normalization of the counts and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) with the parameters betaPrior = true, cooksCutoff = false, and independentFiltering = false.

iCdx2 Trophoblast Stem Cells, clone 2, passage 3, replicate 2
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Samples were analyzed using UTAP software (Kohen et al. 2019). Reads were trimmed using CutAdapt (Martin 2011) (parameters: -a ADAPTER1 -a “A{10}” -a “T{10}” -A “A{10}” -A “T{10}” –times 2 -u 3 -u -3 -q 20 -m 25).
Reads were mapped to genome mm10 using STAR (Dobin et al. 2013) v2.4.2a (parameters: –alignEndsType EndToEnd, –outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.05, –twopassMode Basic - alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds No).
Sample counting was done using STAR, quantifying mm10 RefSeq annotated genes. Further analysis was done for genes having a minimum of five reads in at least one sample. Normalization of the counts and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) with the parameters betaPrior = true, cooksCutoff = false, and independentFiltering = false.

    <Data-Processing>
Samples were analyzed using UTAP software (Kohen et al. 2019). Reads were trimmed using CutAdapt (Martin 2011) (parameters: -a ADAPTER1 -a “A{10}” -a “T{10}” -A “A{10}” -A “T{10}” –times 2 -u 3 -u -3 -q 20 -m 25).
Reads were mapped to genome mm10 using STAR (Dobin et al. 2013) v2.4.2a (parameters: –alignEndsType EndToEnd, –outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.05, –twopassMode Basic - alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds No).
Sample counting was done using STAR, quantifying mm10 RefSeq annotated genes. Further analysis was done for genes having a minimum of five reads in at least one sample. Normalization of the counts and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) with the parameters betaPrior = true, cooksCutoff = false, and independentFiltering = false.

Samples were analyzed using UTAP software (Kohen et al. 2019). Reads were trimmed using CutAdapt (Martin 2011) (parameters: -a ADAPTER1 -a “A{10}” -a “T{10}” -A “A{10}” -A “T{10}” –times 2 -u 3 -u -3 -q 20 -m 25).
Reads were mapped to genome mm10 using STAR (Dobin et al. 2013) v2.4.2a (parameters: –alignEndsType EndToEnd, –outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.05, –twopassMode Basic - alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds No).
Sample counting was done using STAR, quantifying mm10 RefSeq annotated genes. Further analysis was done for genes having a minimum of five reads in at least one sample. Normalization of the counts and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) with the parameters betaPrior = true, cooksCutoff = false, and independentFiltering = false.

KH2 Embryonic Stem Cells, replicate 2
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Samples were analyzed using UTAP software (Kohen et al. 2019). Reads were trimmed using CutAdapt (Martin 2011) (parameters: -a ADAPTER1 -a “A{10}” -a “T{10}” -A “A{10}” -A “T{10}” –times 2 -u 3 -u -3 -q 20 -m 25).
Reads were mapped to genome mm10 using STAR (Dobin et al. 2013) v2.4.2a (parameters: –alignEndsType EndToEnd, –outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.05, –twopassMode Basic - alignSoftClipAtReferenceEnds No).
Sample counting was done using STAR, quantifying mm10 RefSeq annotated genes. Further analysis was done for genes having a minimum of five reads in at least one sample. Normalization of the counts and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) with the parameters betaPrior = true, cooksCutoff = false, and independentFiltering = false.

    <Data-Processing>
Demultiplexing was done with cellranger/3.1.0 mkfastq.
Alignment and quantification of single cell features was done with cellranger counts.
Aggregation of multiple GEM wells was done using- cellranger aggr.
Cells with under 200 expressing genes, over 4000 expressing genes or over 10% mitochondrial gene expression were filtered out for the rest of the analysis.
Assembly: mm10
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data is divided into three different matrices created using Seurat 3.0: raw_counts.csv - contains raw counts of all genes across all cells, normalized_counts.csv - contains normalized counts of all genes across all cells, cell2sample.csv - contains information of each of the cells.

Cells with under 200 expressing genes, over 4000 expressing genes or over 10% mitochondrial gene expression were filtered out for the rest of the analysis.
Assembly: mm10
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data is divided into three different matrices created using Seurat 3.0: raw_counts.csv - contains raw counts of all genes across all cells, normalized_counts.csv - contains normalized counts of all genes across all cells, cell2sample.csv - contains information of each of the cells.
