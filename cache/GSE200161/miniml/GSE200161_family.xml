The collected MSCs from different tissue origins were separately seeded into 75cm2 cell culture flask at the density of 1×106/cm2 with DMEM/F12 medium plus 10% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. Cells were cultivated at 37°C in a saturated humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in the incubator . After 72 h, the non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS solution, after then the medium was changed every three days. The collection of MSCs from each sample was performed at P3 when the cells reached 80% confluence. Samples were treated with 0.05% trypsin for 3 min at 37˚C, the digestion was then stopped by washing twice and re-suspending in PBS containing 0.04% BSA. Cell viability and counting were assessed with trypan blue by microscopy, and single cell suspensions with viabilities &gt;85% were used for library preparation.

Each sample was calculated to an appropriate volume for a target capture of 5000 cells. Single cells were then encapsulated into emulsion droplets using Chromium Controller (10x Genomics).
scRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits V2 (10x Genomics; Pleasanton, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Basecalls performed using bcl2fastq version 2.1.9
The quality of raw sequencing data was evaluated by FastQC. The Cellranger toolkit (version 2.2.0, 10X Genomics) was used to perform sample demultiplexing and mapping reads to the human genome reference data with default settings
Each sample was generated with a gene expression matrix which records the UMI counts per gene associated with each cell barcode. Further analysis (data filtering and normalizing, identification of highly variable genes, dimensionality reduction and clustering, discovery of differentially expressed genes) was performed using R (version 3.6.1) and the Seurat R package (version 3.1.0). Cells with low-quality and very high mitochondrial genome transcripts were removed according to a sample specific cutoff.

The collected MSCs from different tissue origins were separately seeded into 75cm2 cell culture flask at the density of 1×106/cm2 with DMEM/F12 medium plus 10% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. Cells were cultivated at 37°C in a saturated humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in the incubator . After 72 h, the non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS solution, after then the medium was changed every three days. The collection of MSCs from each sample was performed at P3 when the cells reached 80% confluence. Samples were treated with 0.05% trypsin for 3 min at 37˚C, the digestion was then stopped by washing twice and re-suspending in PBS containing 0.04% BSA. Cell viability and counting were assessed with trypan blue by microscopy, and single cell suspensions with viabilities &gt;85% were used for library preparation.

Each sample was calculated to an appropriate volume for a target capture of 5000 cells. Single cells were then encapsulated into emulsion droplets using Chromium Controller (10x Genomics).
scRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits V2 (10x Genomics; Pleasanton, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Basecalls performed using bcl2fastq version 2.1.9
The quality of raw sequencing data was evaluated by FastQC. The Cellranger toolkit (version 2.2.0, 10X Genomics) was used to perform sample demultiplexing and mapping reads to the human genome reference data with default settings
Each sample was generated with a gene expression matrix which records the UMI counts per gene associated with each cell barcode. Further analysis (data filtering and normalizing, identification of highly variable genes, dimensionality reduction and clustering, discovery of differentially expressed genes) was performed using R (version 3.6.1) and the Seurat R package (version 3.1.0). Cells with low-quality and very high mitochondrial genome transcripts were removed according to a sample specific cutoff.

    <Summary>
Here, we use single cell transcriptomics to characterize a dynamic senescence process of in vitro expanded MSC products from adipose tissue (AD), bone marrow (BM), placenta membrane (PM) and umbilical cord (UC). We found that cultured MSCs underwent progressive cell aging. As compared to perinatal MSCs (derived from PM and UC), adult MSCs (derived from AD and BM)  showed higher degree of senescence and impaired immunosuppressive function. Moreover, we identified the transcriptional network regulating the intra-population functional diversity, which provides us guidance to drive reprogramming of determined MSCs lineage with specific cellular functions for a particular therapeutic intent.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
We performed droplet-based scRNA-seq of over 40,000 cells to construct a molecular landscape and dissecting the heterogeneity of MSCs from perinatal and adult human tissues.
