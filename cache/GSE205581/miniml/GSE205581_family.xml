Base calling was conducted using HiSeq Control Software (placenta) or NovaSeq Control Software (decidua), converted to fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina bcl2fastq 2.17 software
Sequence reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence/low-quality sequence using Trimmomatic v.0.36 (Placenta) or BBDUK from BBMap package v.38.90 (Decidua)
Trimmed sequence reads were mapped to GRCm38/mm10 using STAR aligner v.2.5.2b
Read count extraction was performed using Subread package v.1.5.2 (Placenta) or HTSeq-count v.2.0.1 (Decidua)
Read count normalization was performed using DESeq2 package (Placenta) or edgeR (Decidua)
