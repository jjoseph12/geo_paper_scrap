Reads were aligned to the mouse genome using the Splice-aware STAR aligner STAR_2.7.2b
Raw counts were determined using STAR_2.7.2b
Reads uniquely mapped to known mRNAs were used to identify genes with differential expression (praw&lt;0,05) using DESeq2 R package v1.24. Three analyses were performed to compared each tissue layer to their counterparts.

Reads were aligned to the mouse genome using the Splice-aware STAR aligner STAR_2.7.2b
Raw counts were determined using STAR_2.7.2b
Reads uniquely mapped to known mRNAs were used to identify genes with differential expression (praw&lt;0,05) using DESeq2 R package v1.24. Three analyses were performed to compared each tissue layer to their counterparts.

Implantation site from gestation day 18.5 were dissected to separate decidua, myometrium and mesometrial triangle. Each layer was washed in cold PBS and homogenized in TRIzol. RNA was subsequently purified by phenol chloroform extraction.
RNA libraries were prepared according to Illumona's instructions, using Nugen Universal Plus mRNA

    <Summary>
Our objective was to identify gene differentially expressed between B6 and IL-33 KO decidua, myometrium and mesometrial triangle one day prior to parturition.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
RNA was isolated from whole tissue decidua, myometrium and mesometrial of B6 control (n=5) and IL-33 KO (5) mice on gestation day 18.5, one day prior to parturition.One IL-33 KO decidua and one B6 mesometrial triangle were excluded due to failed QC.Next generation sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 4000
