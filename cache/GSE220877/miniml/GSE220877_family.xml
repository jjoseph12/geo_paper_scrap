RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
      </Extract-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

RNA was extracted from placenta tissue from individual subjects using TRi regaents and cleanup was done using the RNeasy Mini Kit per manufacturer’s instructions including on-column DNase digestion. Total RNA was quantified using a sphectrophometrically.
Directional cDNA libraries for mRNA-sequencing were prepared using polyA-mRNA from individual RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq reagents. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was utilized for mRNA isolation using poly-A magnetic beads and was fragmented prior to first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Libraries were generated via PCR including dual-indexed barcodes. Following purification with AmpureXP beads libraries were quantitated using Qubit dsDNA reagents. Pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced (150 bp paired reads) using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument.

    <Data-Processing>
All reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered based on quality score using FASTP and aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the STAR aligner using default settings. Resulting read alignments for each sample were imported in Seqmonk for gene level quantification as counts mapping to annotated genes. Gene counts were imported into R and analysis of differential expression between groups was done using the limma-voom pipeline. Raw counts are included as processed data.
Supplementary files format and content: Processed data are provided as data matrix where rows are gene level quantitation (counts) and columns include samples. A single file is included for all samples.

    <Title>Maternal Nutritional Status Modifies Heat-Associated Growth Restriction in Women with Chronic Malnutrition</Title>

    <Summary>
Rising ambient temperatures represent an imminent risk to pregnant women and infants. Both maternal malnutrition and heat stress during pregnancy contribute to poor fetal growth, the leading cause of diminished child development in low-resource settings. However, studies explicitly examining interactions between these two important environmental factors are lacking. We leveraged maternal and neonatal anthropometry data from a randomized controlled trial focused on improving preconception maternal nutrition (Women First Preconception Nutrition trial) conducted in Thatta Pakistan, where both nutritional deficits and heat stress are prevalent. Multiple linear regression of ambient temperature and neonatal anthropometry at birth (n = 459) showed a negative association between daily maximal temperatures in the first trimester and z-scores of birth length (LGAZ) and head circumference (HCGAZ). Placental mRNA-sequencing and protein analysis showed transcriptomic changes in protein translation, ribosomal proteins and mTORC1 signalling components in term placenta exposed to excessive heat in the first trimester. Targeted metabolomic analysis indicated ambient temperature associated alterations in maternal circulation with decreases in choline concentrations. Notably, negative impacts of heat on birth length were in part mitigated in women randomized to comprehensive maternal nutritional supplementation (MNS) before pregnancy suggesting potential interactions between heat stress and nutritional status of the mother. Collectively the findings bridge critical gaps in our current understanding of how maternal nutrition may provide resilience against adverse effects of heat stress in pregnancy.
