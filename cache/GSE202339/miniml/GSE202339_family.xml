Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (cat no. 15596018, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
Complementary DNA libraries from total RNA samples were prepared with Illumina TruSeq RNA preparation kits (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Barcoded cDNA libraries were multiplexed and sequenced with a HiSeq2000 DNA sequencer (100-bp paired-end reads) using a TruSeq 200-cycle SBS kit (Illumina) at the KUMC Genome Sequencing Facility. Reads from *.fastq files were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37) using CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0.4 (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). mRNA abundance was expressed in reads per kb of exon per million reads mapped.  A false discovery rate of 0.05 was used as a cutoff for significant differential expression (scr versus KD).

    <Description>
Rat TS cells were maintained in stem state medium (RPMI-1640 containing 20% FBS, 50 µm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 µm penicilin and streptomycin, 25 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 4, 1 µg/ml heparin and 70% embrynic fibroblast-conditioned medium. Differentiation was induced by the removal of FGF4, heparin and embrynic fibroblast-conditioned medium, and cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 1% FBS for 12 days.

Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using TRIzol reagent (cat no. 15596018, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
Complementary DNA libraries from total RNA samples were prepared with Illumina TruSeq RNA preparation kits (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Barcoded cDNA libraries were multiplexed and sequenced with a HiSeq2000 DNA sequencer (100-bp paired-end reads) using a TruSeq 200-cycle SBS kit (Illumina) at the KUMC Genome Sequencing Facility. Reads from *.fastq files were mapped to the rat reference genome (Rnor_6.0) using CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0.4 (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). mRNA abundance was expressed in reads per kb of exon per million reads mapped.  A false discovery rate of 0.05 was used as a cutoff for significant differential expression (null versus wild type).

Rat TS cells were maintained in stem state medium (RPMI-1640 containing 20% FBS, 50 µm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 µm penicilin and streptomycin, 25 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 4, 1 µg/ml heparin and 70% embrynic fibroblast-conditioned medium. Differentiation was induced by the removal of FGF4, heparin and embrynic fibroblast-conditioned medium, and cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 1% FBS for 12 days.

Holtzman Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in an environmentally controlled facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) with lights on from 0600 to 2000 h and allowed free access to food and water. Female rats (8-10 weeks of age) were mated with adult male rats (&gt;3 months of age).  Mating was assessed by inspection of vaginal lavages. ­The presence of sperm in the vagina was designated gd 0.5. Placentation sites were dissected on gestation day 12.5 and placental discs were isolated. Dissected placental disc tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until processing for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from tissues using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog No. 15596018). All rats were maintained in accordance with institutional policies for the care and use of vertebrate animals in research using protocols approved by the KUMC Animal Care and Use Committee.

Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using TRIzol reagent (cat no. 15596018, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
Complementary DNA libraries from total RNA samples were prepared with Illumina TruSeq RNA preparation kits (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Barcoded cDNA libraries were multiplexed and sequenced with a HiSeq2000 DNA sequencer (100-bp paired-end reads) using a TruSeq 200-cycle SBS kit (Illumina) at the KUMC Genome Sequencing Facility. Reads from *.fastq files were mapped to the rat reference genome (Rnor_6.0) using CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0.4 (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). mRNA abundance was expressed in reads per kb of exon per million reads mapped.  A false discovery rate of 0.05 was used as a cutoff for significant differential expression (wild type versus null).

    <Description>
Holtzman Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in an environmentally controlled facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) with lights on from 0600 to 2000 h and allowed free access to food and water. Female rats (8-10 weeks of age) were mated with adult male rats (&gt;3 months of age).  Mating was assessed by inspection of vaginal lavages. ­The presence of sperm in the vagina was designated gd 0.5. Placentation sites were dissected on gestation day 12.5 and placental discs were isolated. Dissected placental disc tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until processing for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from tissues using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog No. 15596018). All rats were maintained in accordance with institutional policies for the care and use of vertebrate animals in research using protocols approved by the KUMC Animal Care and Use Committee.

The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3' gene counting. The reads were aligned to the rn6 reference genome. BAM files produced by the 10x Genomics/Cell Ranger pipeline
