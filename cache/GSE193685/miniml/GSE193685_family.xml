C57BL6 (WEHI, Kew, VIC, Australia), Asc null (kindly provided by Millennium Pharmaceuticals) and Nlrp3 null (kindly provided by the University of Lausanne) female (virgin 8-12 weeks) and male (8-52 weeks) were housed under conventional conditions, had ad libitum food and water and were maintained in a 12h: light-dark cycle.

    <Data-Processing>
The primary sequence data was generated using the Illumina bcl2fastq 2.20.0.422 pipeline
The sequence reads from all samples were analysed according to AGRF quality  control measures (Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd.). The reads were also screened for the presence of any Illumina adapter/overrepresented sequences and cross-species contamination. The cleaned sequence reads were then aligned against the mm10 genome. The STAR aligner v2.5.3a was used to map reads to the genomic sequences.
mRNA were identified and kept according to MGI-Mouse Gene Expression Database (GXD). Genes with low raw counts (lower than 15 in 13 samples or more) were removed. For each sample, counts were scaled and normalized by TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) and CPM (counts per million) using the R package edgeR.

The primary sequence data was generated using the Illumina bcl2fastq 2.20.0.422 pipeline
The sequence reads from all samples were analysed according to AGRF quality  control measures (Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd.). The reads were also screened for the presence of any Illumina adapter/overrepresented sequences and cross-species contamination. The cleaned sequence reads were then aligned against the mm10 genome. The STAR aligner v2.5.3a was used to map reads to the genomic sequences.
mRNA were identified and kept according to MGI-Mouse Gene Expression Database (GXD). Genes with low raw counts (lower than 15 in 13 samples or more) were removed. For each sample, counts were scaled and normalized by TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) and CPM (counts per million) using the R package edgeR.

The primary sequence data was generated using the Illumina bcl2fastq 2.20.0.422 pipeline
The sequence reads from all samples were analysed according to AGRF quality  control measures (Australian Genome Research Facility Ltd.). The reads were also screened for the presence of any Illumina adapter/overrepresented sequences and cross-species contamination. The cleaned sequence reads were then aligned against the mm10 genome. The STAR aligner v2.5.3a was used to map reads to the genomic sequences.
mRNA were identified and kept according to MGI-Mouse Gene Expression Database (GXD). Genes with low raw counts (lower than 15 in 13 samples or more) were removed. For each sample, counts were scaled and normalized by TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) and CPM (counts per million) using the R package edgeR.

    <Title>Next-generation sequencing reveals IL11 drives preeclampsia by disrupting trophoblast differentiation and activating the placental inflammasome</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE193685</Accession>
    <Summary>
Preeclampsia is a life-threatening disorder of pregnancy unique to humans. Interleukin (IL)11 is elevated in serum from pregnancies that subsequently develop early-onset preeclampsia and pharmacological elevation of IL11 in pregnant mice causes the development of preeclampsia-like features (hypertension and proteinuria), however, the mechanism by which IL11 drives preeclampsia-like features is unknown. Using Next-generation sequencing we demonstrate that treatment with PEGylated IL11 (PEGIL11) inhibited placental expression of markers of spongiotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast linages and increased placental cathepsin production in wild-type and Asc-/- mice. Function studies showed that IL11 acts via Asc inflammasomes to induce tissue fibrosis and preeclampsia in mice. This study has far-reaching implications on our understanding of the underlying etiology of preeclampsia and the mechanism by which IL11 causes inflammation and fibrosis in many tissues and disease states.
