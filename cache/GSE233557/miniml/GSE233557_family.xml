    <Data-Processing>
Bioinformatic analyses were performed using Partek Flow Genomic Analysis Software (Partek, St. Louis, Missouri, USA).
Sequenced raw FASTQ files were trimmed for Nextera transposase adapters and small RNA adapters.
Trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome hg38 using STAR aligner for mRNA seqeuncing data and Bowtie 2 for small RNA sequencing with default parameters.
Mapped reads were further filtered and quantified to transcripts and genes using hg38 assembly and Ensemble transcripts release 107 for mRNA data and small RNA data was quantified to miRbase v.22 in the partek software.
Assembly: hg38
Supplementary files format and content: tab-delimited text files include filtered counts for each Sample

Trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome hg38 using STAR aligner for mRNA seqeuncing data and Bowtie 2 for small RNA sequencing with default parameters.
Mapped reads were further filtered and quantified to transcripts and genes using hg38 assembly and Ensemble transcripts release 107 for mRNA data and small RNA data was quantified to miRbase v.22 in the partek software.

    <Data-Processing>
Bioinformatic analyses were performed using Partek Flow Genomic Analysis Software (Partek, St. Louis, Missouri, USA).
Sequenced raw FASTQ files were trimmed for Nextera transposase adapters and small RNA adapters.
Trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome hg38 using STAR aligner for mRNA seqeuncing data and Bowtie 2 for small RNA sequencing with default parameters.
Mapped reads were further filtered and quantified to transcripts and genes using hg38 assembly and Ensemble transcripts release 107 for mRNA data and small RNA data was quantified to miRbase v.22 in the partek software.
Assembly: hg38

Bioinformatic analyses were performed using Partek Flow Genomic Analysis Software (Partek, St. Louis, Missouri, USA).
Sequenced raw FASTQ files were trimmed for Nextera transposase adapters and small RNA adapters.
Trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome hg38 using STAR aligner for mRNA seqeuncing data and Bowtie 2 for small RNA sequencing with default parameters.
Mapped reads were further filtered and quantified to transcripts and genes using hg38 assembly and Ensemble transcripts release 107 for mRNA data and small RNA data was quantified to miRbase v.22 in the partek software.

    <Title>Global transcriptomic analysis of placenta from women with gestational SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE233557</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>38338886</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Transcriptomic analysis of the placenta in both maternal and fetal compartments was performed  to investigate the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
16 placental samples from women immediately after term delivery were collected, of which seven had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR before parturition. Extracted total RNA from placental tissues, separately from maternal and fetal compartments, constructed cDNA libraries, and sequenced them to assess mRNA and small RNA expression.
