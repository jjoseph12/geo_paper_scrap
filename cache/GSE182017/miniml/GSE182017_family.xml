hbdTSC cells were grown on a layer of Mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells and cultured in human TSC medium (Okae et al, 2018). HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. hESCs were grown in human embryonic stem cell (hES) medium comprised of Knockout DMEM containing 15% KnockOut serum replacement, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, supplemented with freshly added 4ng/ml bFGF. HFFs infected with lentiviral vectors GOKM or OSKM were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and treated with 2ug/ml doxycycline for 3 days.

50,000 cells per replicate (two biological replicates per line) were incubated with 0.1% NP-40 to isolate nuclei.
ATAC-Seq library preparation was performed as previously described (Buenrostro et al., 2013). After nuclei isolation, nuclei were then transposed for 30 min at 37C with adaptor-loaded Nextera Tn5 (Illumina, Fc-121-1030). Transposed fragments were directly PCR amplified and Sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform to generate 2 x 36-bp paired-end reads.

    <Data-Processing>
For analysis of the accessibility data, raw reads (FastQ files) were quality-trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.6.5, default parameters) and aligned to the human genome GRCh38 using burrows-wheeler aligner (BWA v 0.7.17, 59 )
Peaks were called with MACS2 (v 2.2.7.1 60 ). Differential peak analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package (v 1.28.1, DOI:10.18129/B9.bioc.DESeq2)
Peaks were defined specifically for each group of cells and the R package (Venn v 1.9) was used to construct all Venn diagrams
Peaks that are specific to OSKM D3 and OGKM D3 were differentially identified with FDR&lt;0.05
Intersection of these peaks with hbdTSCs and hESCs allowed for the identification of specific set of peaks that were investigated for possible regulation of nearby genes
GREAT was used to associate these peaks with genes within 250 kb. Extracted genes were then intersected with a specific set of genes that were differentially expressed in hbdTSCs and not in fibroblasts or hESCs, or set of genes that were differentially expressed in hESCs and not in fibroblasts or hbdTSCs

hbdTSC cells were grown on a layer of Mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells and cultured in human TSC medium (Okae et al, 2018). HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. hESCs were grown in human embryonic stem cell (hES) medium comprised of Knockout DMEM containing 15% KnockOut serum replacement, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, supplemented with freshly added 4ng/ml bFGF. HFFs infected with lentiviral vectors GOKM or OSKM were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and treated with 2ug/ml doxycycline for 3 days.

50,000 cells per replicate (two biological replicates per line) were incubated with 0.1% NP-40 to isolate nuclei.
ATAC-Seq library preparation was performed as previously described (Buenrostro et al., 2013). After nuclei isolation, nuclei were then transposed for 30 min at 37C with adaptor-loaded Nextera Tn5 (Illumina, Fc-121-1030). Transposed fragments were directly PCR amplified and Sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform to generate 2 x 36-bp paired-end reads.

    <Data-Processing>
For analysis of the accessibility data, raw reads (FastQ files) were quality-trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.6.5, default parameters) and aligned to the human genome GRCh38 using burrows-wheeler aligner (BWA v 0.7.17, 59 )
Peaks were called with MACS2 (v 2.2.7.1 60 ). Differential peak analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package (v 1.28.1, DOI:10.18129/B9.bioc.DESeq2)
Peaks were defined specifically for each group of cells and the R package (Venn v 1.9) was used to construct all Venn diagrams
Peaks that are specific to OSKM D3 and OGKM D3 were differentially identified with FDR&lt;0.05
Intersection of these peaks with hbdTSCs and hESCs allowed for the identification of specific set of peaks that were investigated for possible regulation of nearby genes
GREAT was used to associate these peaks with genes within 250 kb. Extracted genes were then intersected with a specific set of genes that were differentially expressed in hbdTSCs and not in fibroblasts or hESCs, or set of genes that were differentially expressed in hESCs and not in fibroblasts or hbdTSCs

hbdTSC cells were grown on a layer of Mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells and cultured in human TSC medium (Okae et al, 2018). HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. hESCs were grown in human embryonic stem cell (hES) medium comprised of Knockout DMEM containing 15% KnockOut serum replacement, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, supplemented with freshly added 4ng/ml bFGF. HFFs infected with lentiviral vectors GOKM or OSKM were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and treated with 2ug/ml doxycycline for 3 days.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as previously described (Mendenhall et al., 2013). Briefly, cells from two biological replicates per line were fixed for 10min at RT with a final formaldehyde concentration of 0.8%. Formaldehyde was quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 125mM. The cells were then lysed with lysis buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 300mM NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2%v sodium deoxycholate and 10mM Cacl2) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche, 11873580001) for 20min on ice. The chromatin was digested by adding MNase (Thermo Scientific, 88216) for 20min at 37C and MNase was inactivated by adding 20mM EGTA. The fragmented chromatin was added to pre-bounded Dynabeads (A and G mix, Invitrogen, 10004D/ 10002D) using H3K4me2 antibody (Millipore, 07-030) at 2 ug per reaction. Samples were then washed twice with RIPA buffer, twice with RIPA high salt buffer (NaCl 360mM), twice with LiCl wash buffer (10mM Tris-Hcl, 250mM LiCl, 0.5% DOC, 1mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL) and twice with 10mM Tris-HCl pH = 8. DNA was purified by adding RNase A (Thermo Scientific, EN0531) and incubated for 30 min at 37C and then with Proteinase K (Invitrogen, 25530049) for 2h. The DNA was eluted by adding 2X concentrated elution buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, 300mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 2mM EDTA) and reverse crosslinked overnight at 65C. The DNA was then extracted using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, A63881).
ChIP sample libraries were prepared according to Illumina Genomic DNA protocol.

For analysis of the H3K4me2 activity data, raw reads (FastQ files) were quality-trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.6.5, default parameters) and aligned to the human genome GRCh38 using burrows-wheeler aligner (BWA v 0.7.17, 59 )
Peaks were called with MACS2 (v 2.2.7.1 60 ). Differential peak analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package (v 1.28.1, DOI:10.18129/B9.bioc.DESeq2)
Peaks were defined specifically for each group of cells and the R package (Venn v 1.9) was used to construct all Venn diagrams
Peaks that are specific to OSKM D3 and OGKM D3 were differentially identified with FDR&lt;0.05
Intersection of these peaks with hbdTSCs and hESCs allowed for the identification of specific set of peaks that were investigated for possible regulation of nearby genes
GREAT was used to associate these peaks with genes within 250 kb. Extracted genes were then intersected with a specific set of genes that were differentially expressed in hbdTSCs and not in fibroblasts or hESCs, or set of genes that were differentially expressed in hESCs and not in fibroblasts or hbdTSCs

HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. hESCs were grown in human embryonic stem cell (hES) medium comprised of Knockout DMEM containing 15% KnockOut serum replacement, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, supplemented with freshly added 4ng/ml bFGF. HFFs infected with lentiviral vectors GOKM or OSKM were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and treated with 2ug/ml doxycycline for 3 days.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as previously described (Mendenhall et al., 2013). Briefly, cells from two biological replicates per line were fixed for 10min at RT with a final formaldehyde concentration of 0.8%. Formaldehyde was quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 125mM. The cells were then lysed with lysis buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 300mM NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2%v sodium deoxycholate and 10mM Cacl2) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche, 11873580001) for 20min on ice. The chromatin was digested by adding MNase (Thermo Scientific, 88216) for 20min at 37C and MNase was inactivated by adding 20mM EGTA. The fragmented chromatin was added to pre-bounded Dynabeads (A and G mix, Invitrogen, 10004D/ 10002D) using H3K4me2 antibody (Millipore, 07-030) at 2 ug per reaction. Samples were then washed twice with RIPA buffer, twice with RIPA high salt buffer (NaCl 360mM), twice with LiCl wash buffer (10mM Tris-Hcl, 250mM LiCl, 0.5% DOC, 1mM EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL) and twice with 10mM Tris-HCl pH = 8. DNA was purified by adding RNase A (Thermo Scientific, EN0531) and incubated for 30 min at 37C and then with Proteinase K (Invitrogen, 25530049) for 2h. The DNA was eluted by adding 2X concentrated elution buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, 300mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 2mM EDTA) and reverse crosslinked overnight at 65C. The DNA was then extracted using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, A63881).
ChIP sample libraries were prepared according to Illumina Genomic DNA protocol.

For analysis of the H3K4me2 activity data, raw reads (FastQ files) were quality-trimmed using Trim Galore (v0.6.5, default parameters) and aligned to the human genome GRCh38 using burrows-wheeler aligner (BWA v 0.7.17, 59 )
Peaks were called with MACS2 (v 2.2.7.1 60 ). Differential peak analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package (v 1.28.1, DOI:10.18129/B9.bioc.DESeq2)
Peaks were defined specifically for each group of cells and the R package (Venn v 1.9) was used to construct all Venn diagrams
Peaks that are specific to OSKM D3 and OGKM D3 were differentially identified with FDR&lt;0.05
Intersection of these peaks with hbdTSCs and hESCs allowed for the identification of specific set of peaks that were investigated for possible regulation of nearby genes
GREAT was used to associate these peaks with genes within 250 kb. Extracted genes were then intersected with a specific set of genes that were differentially expressed in hbdTSCs and not in fibroblasts or hESCs, or set of genes that were differentially expressed in hESCs and not in fibroblasts or hbdTSCs

hiTSC and hbdTSC cells were grown on a layer of Mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells and cultured in human TSC medium (Okae et al, 2018). HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10%FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. hiTSC and hbdTSC cells were passaged twice on matrigel in order to minimize the presence of MEF feeder cells. hESCs and hiPSCs were grown in human embryonic stem cell (hES) medium comprised of Knockout DMEM containing 15% KnockOut serum replacement, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, supplemented with freshly added 4ng/ml bFGF.

hiTSC and hbdTSC cells were grown on a layer of Mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells and cultured in human TSC medium (Okae et al, 2018). HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10%FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. hiTSC and hbdTSC cells were passaged twice on matrigel in order to minimize the presence of MEF feeder cells. hESCs and hiPSCs were grown in human embryonic stem cell (hES) medium comprised of Knockout DMEM containing 15% KnockOut serum replacement, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, supplemented with freshly added 4ng/ml bFGF.

hiTSC and hbdTSC cells were grown on a layer of Mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells and cultured in human TSC medium (Okae et al, 2018). HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10%FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. hiTSC and hbdTSC cells were passaged twice on matrigel in order to minimize the presence of MEF feeder cells. hESCs and hiPSCs were grown in human embryonic stem cell (hES) medium comprised of Knockout DMEM containing 15% KnockOut serum replacement, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, supplemented with freshly added 4ng/ml bFGF.

hbdTSC cells were grown in human TSC medium (Okae et al, 2018). HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10%FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. hiPSCs were grown in human embryonic stem cell (hES) medium comprised of Knockout DMEM containing 15% KnockOut serum replacement, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, supplemented with freshly added 4ng/ml bFGF. Infected-HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10%FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin supplamentd with 2ug/ml doxycycline for 14 days, 1:1 with human TSC medium for 7 days and  human TSC medium for 3 days.

hbdTSC cells were grown in human TSC medium (Okae et al, 2018). HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10%FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. hiPSCs were grown in human embryonic stem cell (hES) medium comprised of Knockout DMEM containing 15% KnockOut serum replacement, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, supplemented with freshly added 4ng/ml bFGF. Infected-HFFs were grown in DMEM containing 10%FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin supplamentd with 2ug/ml doxycycline for 14 days, 1:1 with human TSC medium for 7 days and  human TSC medium for 3 days.
