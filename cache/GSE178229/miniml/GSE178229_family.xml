    <Summary>
We  are reporting  the expression pattern of placental transcriptome in a celltype specific manner from Gestational D19 mouse exposed to Air -Pollutant material.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Placenta was collected from gestational Day19 (D19) of C57BL/6J mouse either exposed to air pollutant material or sterile PBS during the entire gestation period (from D1 of conception to D18). Three different compartments of placenta (Decidua, Junction and Labyrinth) were separated under the microscope and single cell suspension was prepared to make scRNA sequencing library.
