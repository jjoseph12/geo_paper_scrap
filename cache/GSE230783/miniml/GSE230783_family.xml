raw reads were were mapped to GRCm39 using STAR v.2.7.10b (with options --outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0.3 and --outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0.3 )
featureCounts v.2.0.3 was used for generating raw counts using gencode.vM30 GTF file, at exon level, per gene. Reads were treated as pairs and merged counts for all sampled were created
Read count extraction and normalization were performed using DESeq2 on Rstudio.
Enrichment tests on the differentially expressed genes were performed using TissueEnrich against the mouse Encode dataset and using enrichR databases

featureCounts v.2.0.3 was used for generating raw counts using gencode.vM30 GTF file, at exon level, per gene. Reads were treated as pairs and merged counts for all sampled were created
Read count extraction and normalization were performed using DESeq2 on Rstudio.
Enrichment tests on the differentially expressed genes were performed using TissueEnrich against the mouse Encode dataset and using enrichR databases
