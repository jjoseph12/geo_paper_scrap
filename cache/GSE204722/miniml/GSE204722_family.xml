Human TS cells (Okae et al. 2018) were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (CB40233, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

The Omni-ATAC library preparation was performed on freshly isolated cells according to the established protocol (Corces et al. 2017) until the post-transposition cleanup step. After the cleanup of the transposed DNA was complete, samples were stored at -20°C until library amplification.
The samples underwent 5 cycles of PCR before an aliquot was used in a quantitative PCR (qPCR) reaction to determine whether additional amplification was required. An Applied Biosciences Viia7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosciences, Beverly Hills, CA) was used for qPCR and the number of additional PCR cycles needed was determined from the multicomponent plot, which plots fluorescence versus the number of PCR cycles. The maximum fluorescence for each sample was found from the plot, ¼ of the maximum fluorescence value was calculated, and the number of additional PCR cycles needed was determined by determining the cycle number that reached ¼ maximum fluorescence on the graph. In cases where the ¼ maximum fluorescence value was halfway between two cycle numbers, the lower number of cycles was selected since slight under-amplification was more favorable than overamplification. The original samples were then PCR amplified with their determined number of additional cycles. Cleanup of the samples was performed after PCR amplification according to the published protocol (Corces et al. 2017). Libraries were quantified using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Q32853, Thermo-Fisher) and the size was determined with a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit (5067-4626, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).

Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

The Omni-ATAC library preparation was performed on freshly isolated cells according to the established protocol (Corces et al. 2017) until the post-transposition cleanup step. After the cleanup of the transposed DNA was complete, samples were stored at -20°C until library amplification.
The samples underwent 5 cycles of PCR before an aliquot was used in a quantitative PCR (qPCR) reaction to determine whether additional amplification was required. An Applied Biosciences Viia7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosciences, Beverly Hills, CA) was used for qPCR and the number of additional PCR cycles needed was determined from the multicomponent plot, which plots fluorescence versus the number of PCR cycles. The maximum fluorescence for each sample was found from the plot, ¼ of the maximum fluorescence value was calculated, and the number of additional PCR cycles needed was determined by determining the cycle number that reached ¼ maximum fluorescence on the graph. In cases where the ¼ maximum fluorescence value was halfway between two cycle numbers, the lower number of cycles was selected since slight under-amplification was more favorable than overamplification. The original samples were then PCR amplified with their determined number of additional cycles. Cleanup of the samples was performed after PCR amplification according to the published protocol (Corces et al. 2017). Libraries were quantified using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Q32853, Thermo-Fisher) and the size was determined with a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit (5067-4626, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).

Human TS cells (Okae et al. 2018) were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (CB40233, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

The Omni-ATAC library preparation was performed on freshly isolated cells according to the established protocol (Corces et al. 2017) until the post-transposition cleanup step. After the cleanup of the transposed DNA was complete, samples were stored at -20°C until library amplification.
The samples underwent 5 cycles of PCR before an aliquot was used in a quantitative PCR (qPCR) reaction to determine whether additional amplification was required. An Applied Biosciences Viia7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosciences, Beverly Hills, CA) was used for qPCR and the number of additional PCR cycles needed was determined from the multicomponent plot, which plots fluorescence versus the number of PCR cycles. The maximum fluorescence for each sample was found from the plot, ¼ of the maximum fluorescence value was calculated, and the number of additional PCR cycles needed was determined by determining the cycle number that reached ¼ maximum fluorescence on the graph. In cases where the ¼ maximum fluorescence value was halfway between two cycle numbers, the lower number of cycles was selected since slight under-amplification was more favorable than overamplification. The original samples were then PCR amplified with their determined number of additional cycles. Cleanup of the samples was performed after PCR amplification according to the published protocol (Corces et al. 2017). Libraries were quantified using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Q32853, Thermo-Fisher) and the size was determined with a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit (5067-4626, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).

Human TS cells (Okae et al. 2018) were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (CB40233, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

The Omni-ATAC library preparation was performed on freshly isolated cells according to the established protocol (Corces et al. 2017) until the post-transposition cleanup step. After the cleanup of the transposed DNA was complete, samples were stored at -20°C until library amplification.
The samples underwent 5 cycles of PCR before an aliquot was used in a quantitative PCR (qPCR) reaction to determine whether additional amplification was required. An Applied Biosciences Viia7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosciences, Beverly Hills, CA) was used for qPCR and the number of additional PCR cycles needed was determined from the multicomponent plot, which plots fluorescence versus the number of PCR cycles. The maximum fluorescence for each sample was found from the plot, ¼ of the maximum fluorescence value was calculated, and the number of additional PCR cycles needed was determined by determining the cycle number that reached ¼ maximum fluorescence on the graph. In cases where the ¼ maximum fluorescence value was halfway between two cycle numbers, the lower number of cycles was selected since slight under-amplification was more favorable than overamplification. The original samples were then PCR amplified with their determined number of additional cycles. Cleanup of the samples was performed after PCR amplification according to the published protocol (Corces et al. 2017). Libraries were quantified using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Q32853, Thermo-Fisher) and the size was determined with a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit (5067-4626, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).

RNA was isolated with a TRIzol/chloroform precipitation followed by a cleanup with a RNeasy Mini Kit (74104, Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Frozen cell isolates in TRIzol were thawed on ice prior to starting the isolation. Once thawed, the samples were placed at room temperature for 5 min to promote dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Next, 200 μL of chloroform was added to each sample with vigorous shaking for 15 sec. Samples were placed at room temperature for 3 min before centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the upper, colorless, aqueous phase was removed and transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol added. Isolates containing ethanol were mixed thoroughly by pipetting and 650 μl transferred to a RNeasy spin column. The protocol for the RNeasy Mini Kit was then followed to clean the sample post-TRIzol/chloroform extraction. RNA was then quantified using a Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit and RNA integrity assessed using RNA ScreenTape (5067-5577 and 5067-5576, Agilent) on the Agilent TapeStation platform (Agilent) prior to library preparation
RNA libraries were prepared using a TruSeq Stranded RNA HT Sample Prep Kit (RS-122-2303, Illuminaon a Caliper Sciclone G3 platform (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) . Manual bead cleanup was performed using AMPure XP Beads (A63881, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) after llibrary preparation to remove primer-dimers. 1.0x volume of beads was added to the entire library volume. Samples were mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before being placed on a magnetic stand until the supernatant cleared. Once clear, the supernatant was removed and discarded, and the beads were washed twice with 80% ethanol while still on the magnet. Any residual ethanol was removed, and the beads were air-dried on the magnet for 5 min at room temperature. Once dry, 30 μL of Resuspension Buffer was added to each sample, the beads were resuspended by pipetting, and the solution incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Samples were then placed on a magnet until the supernatant was clear. The supernatant was then transferred to a new plate. A Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit was used to determine the concentration of the library and a Fragment Analyzer Standard Sensitivity NGS Fragment Kit (DNF-473-10000, Agilent) was used to detect the size of the library and to verify removal of excess primer-dimers. Standard Illumina Free-Adapter Blocking was performed on the libraries.
Cleaned, adapter-blocked libraries were loaded on a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with a run configuration of 151x8x8x151 and an average depth of 70M PE reads per library.

Human TS cells (Okae et al. 2018) were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (CB40233, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

RNA was isolated with a TRIzol/chloroform precipitation followed by a cleanup with a RNeasy Mini Kit (74104, Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Frozen cell isolates in TRIzol were thawed on ice prior to starting the isolation. Once thawed, the samples were placed at room temperature for 5 min to promote dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Next, 200 μL of chloroform was added to each sample with vigorous shaking for 15 sec. Samples were placed at room temperature for 3 min before centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the upper, colorless, aqueous phase was removed and transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol added. Isolates containing ethanol were mixed thoroughly by pipetting and 650 μl transferred to a RNeasy spin column. The protocol for the RNeasy Mini Kit was then followed to clean the sample post-TRIzol/chloroform extraction. RNA was then quantified using a Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit and RNA integrity assessed using RNA ScreenTape (5067-5577 and 5067-5576, Agilent) on the Agilent TapeStation platform (Agilent) prior to library preparation
RNA libraries were prepared using a TruSeq Stranded RNA HT Sample Prep Kit (RS-122-2303, Illuminaon a Caliper Sciclone G3 platform (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) . Manual bead cleanup was performed using AMPure XP Beads (A63881, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) after llibrary preparation to remove primer-dimers. 1.0x volume of beads was added to the entire library volume. Samples were mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before being placed on a magnetic stand until the supernatant cleared. Once clear, the supernatant was removed and discarded, and the beads were washed twice with 80% ethanol while still on the magnet. Any residual ethanol was removed, and the beads were air-dried on the magnet for 5 min at room temperature. Once dry, 30 μL of Resuspension Buffer was added to each sample, the beads were resuspended by pipetting, and the solution incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Samples were then placed on a magnet until the supernatant was clear. The supernatant was then transferred to a new plate.

Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

RNA was isolated with a TRIzol/chloroform precipitation followed by a cleanup with a RNeasy Mini Kit (74104, Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Frozen cell isolates in TRIzol were thawed on ice prior to starting the isolation. Once thawed, the samples were placed at room temperature for 5 min to promote dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Next, 200 μL of chloroform was added to each sample with vigorous shaking for 15 sec. Samples were placed at room temperature for 3 min before centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the upper, colorless, aqueous phase was removed and transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol added. Isolates containing ethanol were mixed thoroughly by pipetting and 650 μl transferred to a RNeasy spin column. The protocol for the RNeasy Mini Kit was then followed to clean the sample post-TRIzol/chloroform extraction. RNA was then quantified using a Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit and RNA integrity assessed using RNA ScreenTape (5067-5577 and 5067-5576, Agilent) on the Agilent TapeStation platform (Agilent) prior to library preparation
RNA libraries were prepared using a TruSeq Stranded RNA HT Sample Prep Kit (RS-122-2303, Illuminaon a Caliper Sciclone G3 platform (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) . Manual bead cleanup was performed using AMPure XP Beads (A63881, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) after llibrary preparation to remove primer-dimers. 1.0x volume of beads was added to the entire library volume. Samples were mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before being placed on a magnetic stand until the supernatant cleared. Once clear, the supernatant was removed and discarded, and the beads were washed twice with 80% ethanol while still on the magnet. Any residual ethanol was removed, and the beads were air-dried on the magnet for 5 min at room temperature. Once dry, 30 μL of Resuspension Buffer was added to each sample, the beads were resuspended by pipetting, and the solution incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Samples were then placed on a magnet until the supernatant was clear. The supernatant was then transferred to a new plate. A Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit was used to determine the concentration of the library and a Fragment Analyzer Standard Sensitivity NGS Fragment Kit (DNF-473-10000, Agilent) was used to detect the size of the library and to verify removal of excess primer-dimers. Standard Illumina Free-Adapter Blocking was performed on the libraries.
Cleaned, adapter-blocked libraries were loaded on a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with a run configuration of 151x8x8x151 and an average depth of 70M PE reads per library.

Once dry, 30 μL of Resuspension Buffer was added to each sample, the beads were resuspended by pipetting, and the solution incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Samples were then placed on a magnet until the supernatant was clear. The supernatant was then transferred to a new plate. A Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit was used to determine the concentration of the library and a Fragment Analyzer Standard Sensitivity NGS Fragment Kit (DNF-473-10000, Agilent) was used to detect the size of the library and to verify removal of excess primer-dimers. Standard Illumina Free-Adapter Blocking was performed on the libraries.
Cleaned, adapter-blocked libraries were loaded on a NovaSeq6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with a run configuration of 151x8x8x151 and an average depth of 70M PE reads per library.

Human TS cells (Okae et al. 2018) were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (CB40233, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%.

RNA was isolated with a TRIzol/chloroform precipitation followed by a cleanup with a RNeasy Mini Kit (74104, Qiagen, Germantown, MD). Frozen cell isolates in TRIzol were thawed on ice prior to starting the isolation. Once thawed, the samples were placed at room temperature for 5 min to promote dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Next, 200 μL of chloroform was added to each sample with vigorous shaking for 15 sec. Samples were placed at room temperature for 3 min before centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the upper, colorless, aqueous phase was removed and transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and 1.5 volumes of 100% ethanol added. Isolates containing ethanol were mixed thoroughly by pipetting and 650 μl transferred to a RNeasy spin column. The protocol for the RNeasy Mini Kit was then followed to clean the sample post-TRIzol/chloroform extraction. RNA was then quantified using a Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit and RNA integrity assessed using RNA ScreenTape (5067-5577 and 5067-5576, Agilent) on the Agilent TapeStation platform (Agilent) prior to library preparation
RNA libraries were prepared using a TruSeq Stranded RNA HT Sample Prep Kit (RS-122-2303, Illuminaon a Caliper Sciclone G3 platform (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) . Manual bead cleanup was performed using AMPure XP Beads (A63881, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) after llibrary preparation to remove primer-dimers. 1.0x volume of beads was added to the entire library volume. Samples were mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 5 min before being placed on a magnetic stand until the supernatant cleared. Once clear, the supernatant was removed and discarded, and the beads were washed twice with 80% ethanol while still on the magnet. Any residual ethanol was removed, and the beads were air-dried on the magnet for 5 min at room temperature. Once dry, 30 μL of Resuspension Buffer was added to each sample, the beads were resuspended by pipetting, and the solution incubated for 2 min at room temperature.

EPAS1-specific shRNA lentiviral transduction and puromycin selection
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery was used as a tool to test the biological roles for TFAP2C, EPAS1, SNAI1, DLX5, and DLX6 in human TS cells. Several shRNAs designed for each target were subcloned into pLKO.1 and their efficacy tested by RT-qPCR and western blotting. An shRNA which does not recognize any known mammalian gene, pLKO.1-shSCR (Plasmid 1864) was used as a control (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Construct design, lentivirus production, and lentiviral transduction were performed as previously described (Varberg et al. 2021).

Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using TRIzolreagent (cat no. 15596018, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
The Stranded mRNA-Seq was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing Systemat the University of Kansas Medical Center –Genomics Core (Kansas City, KS). Quality control on RNA submissions was completed using the Agilent TapeStation 4200 using the RNA ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5576). Total RNA (1ug) was used toinitiatethe library preparation protocol.The total RNA fraction was processed by oligo dT bead capture of mRNA, fragmentation, reverse transcriptioninto cDNA, end repair of cDNA, ligation withthe appropriate Unique Dual Index (UDI) adaptors, strand selection and library amplification by PCR using the Universal Plus mRNA-seq with NuQuant library preparation kit (Tecan Genomics 0520-A01).Library validation was performed using the D1000 ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5582) on theAgilent TapeStation 4200. Concentration of each library was determined with the NuQuant module of the library prep kit using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen),Libraries were pooled based on equal molar amounts and the multiplexed pool was quantitated, in triplicate, using the Roche Lightcycler96 withFastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche 06402712001) and KAPA Library Quant (Illumina) DNA Standards 1-6 (KAPA Biosystems KK4903). Using the qPCR results, theRNA-Seq library pool was adjusted to 2.125nM for multiplexed sequencing.Pooled libraries were denatured with 0.2N NaOH (0.04N final concentration) and neutralized with 400mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. A dilution of the pooled libraries to 425 pM is performed in the sample tube, on instrument, followed by onboard clonal clustering of the patterned flow cell using the NovaSeq 6000 S1 Reagent Kit (200 cycle) (Illumina 20012864). A 2x101 cycle sequencing profile with dual index reads is completed using the following sequence profile: Read 1 – 101 cycles x Index Read 1 – 8 cycles x Index Read 2 – 8 cycles x Read 2 – 101 cycles. Following collection, sequence data is converted from .bcl file format to fastq file format using bcl2fastq software and de-multiplexed into individual sequences for data distribution using a secure FTP site or Illumina BaseSpace for further downstream analysis.

      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery was used as a tool to test the biological roles for TFAP2C, EPAS1, SNAI1, DLX5, and DLX6 in human TS cells. Several shRNAs designed for each target were subcloned into pLKO.1 and their efficacy tested by RT-qPCR and western blotting. An shRNA which does not recognize any known mammalian gene, pLKO.1-shSCR (Plasmid 1864) was used as a control (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Construct design, lentivirus production, and lentiviral transduction were performed as previously described (Varberg et al. 2021).

Human TS cells (Okae et al. 2018) were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (CB40233, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using TRIzolreagent (cat no. 15596018, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
The Stranded mRNA-Seq was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing Systemat the University of Kansas Medical Center –Genomics Core (Kansas City, KS). Quality control on RNA submissions was completed using the Agilent TapeStation 4200 using the RNA ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5576). Total RNA (1ug) was used toinitiatethe library preparation protocol.The total RNA fraction was processed by oligo dT bead capture of mRNA, fragmentation, reverse transcriptioninto cDNA, end repair of cDNA, ligation withthe appropriate Unique Dual Index (UDI) adaptors, strand selection and library amplification by PCR using the Universal Plus mRNA-seq with NuQuant library preparation kit (Tecan Genomics 0520-A01).Library validation was performed using the D1000 ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5582) on theAgilent TapeStation 4200. Concentration of each library was determined with the NuQuant module of the library prep kit using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen),Libraries were pooled based on equal molar amounts and the multiplexed pool was quantitated, in triplicate, using the Roche Lightcycler96 withFastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche 06402712001) and KAPA Library Quant (Illumina) DNA Standards 1-6 (KAPA Biosystems KK4903). Using the qPCR results, theRNA-Seq library pool was adjusted to 2.125nM for multiplexed sequencing.Pooled libraries were denatured with 0.2N NaOH (0.04N final concentration) and neutralized with 400mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. A dilution of the pooled libraries to 425 pM is performed in the sample tube, on instrument, followed by onboard clonal clustering of the patterned flow cell using the NovaSeq 6000 S1 Reagent Kit (200 cycle) (Illumina 20012864). A 2x101 cycle sequencing profile with dual index reads is completed using the following sequence profile: Read 1 – 101 cycles x Index Read 1 – 8 cycles x Index Read 2 – 8 cycles x Read 2 – 101 cycles. Following collection, sequence data is converted from .bcl file format to fastq file format using bcl2fastq software and de-multiplexed into individual sequences for data distribution using a secure FTP site or Illumina BaseSpace for further downstream analysis.

Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using TRIzolreagent (cat no. 15596018, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
The Stranded mRNA-Seq was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing Systemat the University of Kansas Medical Center –Genomics Core (Kansas City, KS). Quality control on RNA submissions was completed using the Agilent TapeStation 4200 using the RNA ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5576). Total RNA (1ug) was used toinitiatethe library preparation protocol.The total RNA fraction was processed by oligo dT bead capture of mRNA, fragmentation, reverse transcriptioninto cDNA, end repair of cDNA, ligation withthe appropriate Unique Dual Index (UDI) adaptors, strand selection and library amplification by PCR using the Universal Plus mRNA-seq with NuQuant library preparation kit (Tecan Genomics 0520-A01).Library validation was performed using the D1000 ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5582) on theAgilent TapeStation 4200. Concentration of each library was determined with the NuQuant module of the library prep kit using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen),Libraries were pooled based on equal molar amounts and the multiplexed pool was quantitated, in triplicate, using the Roche Lightcycler96 withFastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche 06402712001) and KAPA Library Quant (Illumina) DNA Standards 1-6 (KAPA Biosystems KK4903). Using the qPCR results, theRNA-Seq library pool was adjusted to 2.125nM for multiplexed sequencing.Pooled libraries were denatured with 0.2N NaOH (0.04N final concentration) and neutralized with 400mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. A dilution of the pooled libraries to 425 pM is performed in the sample tube, on instrument, followed by onboard clonal clustering of the patterned flow cell using the NovaSeq 6000 S1 Reagent Kit (200 cycle) (Illumina 20012864). A 2x101 cycle sequencing profile with dual index reads is completed using the following sequence profile: Read 1 – 101 cycles x Index Read 1 – 8 cycles x Index Read 2 – 8 cycles x Read 2 – 101 cycles. Following collection, sequence data is converted from .bcl file format to fastq file format using bcl2fastq software and de-multiplexed into individual sequences for data distribution using a secure FTP site or Illumina BaseSpace for further downstream analysis.

Control shRNA lentiviral transduction and puromycin selection
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery was used as a tool to test the biological roles for TFAP2C, EPAS1, SNAI1, DLX5, and DLX6 in human TS cells. Several shRNAs designed for each target were subcloned into pLKO.1 and their efficacy tested by RT-qPCR and western blotting. An shRNA which does not recognize any known mammalian gene, pLKO.1-shSCR (Plasmid 1864) was used as a control (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Construct design, lentivirus production, and lentiviral transduction were performed as previously described (Varberg et al. 2021).

SNAI1-specific shRNA lentiviral transduction and puromycin selection
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery was used as a tool to test the biological roles for TFAP2C, EPAS1, SNAI1, DLX5, and DLX6 in human TS cells. Several shRNAs designed for each target were subcloned into pLKO.1 and their efficacy tested by RT-qPCR and western blotting. An shRNA which does not recognize any known mammalian gene, pLKO.1-shSCR (Plasmid 1864) was used as a control (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Construct design, lentivirus production, and lentiviral transduction were performed as previously described (Varberg et al. 2021).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Human TS cells (Okae et al. 2018) were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (CB40233, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using TRIzolreagent (cat no. 15596018, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
The Stranded mRNA-Seq was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing Systemat the University of Kansas Medical Center –Genomics Core (Kansas City, KS). Quality control on RNA submissions was completed using the Agilent TapeStation 4200 using the RNA ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5576). Total RNA (1ug) was used toinitiatethe library preparation protocol.The total RNA fraction was processed by oligo dT bead capture of mRNA, fragmentation, reverse transcriptioninto cDNA, end repair of cDNA, ligation withthe appropriate Unique Dual Index (UDI) adaptors, strand selection and library amplification by PCR using the Universal Plus mRNA-seq with NuQuant library preparation kit (Tecan Genomics 0520-A01).Library validation was performed using the D1000 ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5582) on theAgilent TapeStation 4200. Concentration of each library was determined with the NuQuant module of the library prep kit using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen),Libraries were pooled based on equal molar amounts and the multiplexed pool was quantitated, in triplicate, using the Roche Lightcycler96 withFastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche 06402712001) and KAPA Library Quant (Illumina) DNA Standards 1-6 (KAPA Biosystems KK4903). Using the qPCR results, theRNA-Seq library pool was adjusted to 2.125nM for multiplexed sequencing.Pooled libraries were denatured with 0.2N NaOH (0.04N final concentration) and neutralized with 400mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. A dilution of the pooled libraries to 425 pM is performed in the sample tube, on instrument, followed by onboard clonal clustering of the patterned flow cell using the NovaSeq 6000 S1 Reagent Kit (200 cycle) (Illumina 20012864).

TFAP2C-specific shRNA lentiviral transduction and puromycin selection
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery was used as a tool to test the biological roles for TFAP2C, EPAS1, SNAI1, DLX5, and DLX6 in human TS cells. Several shRNAs designed for each target were subcloned into pLKO.1 and their efficacy tested by RT-qPCR and western blotting. An shRNA which does not recognize any known mammalian gene, pLKO.1-shSCR (Plasmid 1864) was used as a control (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Construct design, lentivirus production, and lentiviral transduction were performed as previously described (Varberg et al. 2021).

      <Growth-Protocol>
Human TS cells (Okae et al. 2018) were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (CB40233, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using TRIzolreagent (cat no. 15596018, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
The Stranded mRNA-Seq was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing Systemat the University of Kansas Medical Center –Genomics Core (Kansas City, KS). Quality control on RNA submissions was completed using the Agilent TapeStation 4200 using the RNA ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5576). Total RNA (1ug) was used toinitiatethe library preparation protocol.The total RNA fraction was processed by oligo dT bead capture of mRNA, fragmentation, reverse transcriptioninto cDNA, end repair of cDNA, ligation withthe appropriate Unique Dual Index (UDI) adaptors, strand selection and library amplification by PCR using the Universal Plus mRNA-seq with NuQuant library preparation kit (Tecan Genomics 0520-A01).Library validation was performed using the D1000 ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5582) on theAgilent TapeStation 4200. Concentration of each library was determined with the NuQuant module of the library prep kit using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen),Libraries were pooled based on equal molar amounts and the multiplexed pool was quantitated, in triplicate, using the Roche Lightcycler96 withFastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche 06402712001) and KAPA Library Quant (Illumina) DNA Standards 1-6 (KAPA Biosystems KK4903). Using the qPCR results, theRNA-Seq library pool was adjusted to 2.125nM for multiplexed sequencing.Pooled libraries were denatured with 0.2N NaOH (0.04N final concentration) and neutralized with 400mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. A dilution of the pooled libraries to 425 pM is performed in the sample tube, on instrument, followed by onboard clonal clustering of the patterned flow cell using the NovaSeq 6000 S1 Reagent Kit (200 cycle) (Illumina 20012864). A 2x101 cycle sequencing profile with dual index reads is completed using the following sequence profile: Read 1 – 101 cycles x Index Read 1 – 8 cycles x Index Read 2 – 8 cycles x Read 2 – 101 cycles. Following collection, sequence data is converted from .bcl file format to fastq file format using bcl2fastq software and de-multiplexed into individual sequences for data distribution using a secure FTP site or Illumina BaseSpace for further downstream analysis.

On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using TRIzolreagent (cat no. 15596018, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).
The Stranded mRNA-Seq was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing Systemat the University of Kansas Medical Center –Genomics Core (Kansas City, KS). Quality control on RNA submissions was completed using the Agilent TapeStation 4200 using the RNA ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5576). Total RNA (1ug) was used toinitiatethe library preparation protocol.The total RNA fraction was processed by oligo dT bead capture of mRNA, fragmentation, reverse transcriptioninto cDNA, end repair of cDNA, ligation withthe appropriate Unique Dual Index (UDI) adaptors, strand selection and library amplification by PCR using the Universal Plus mRNA-seq with NuQuant library preparation kit (Tecan Genomics 0520-A01).Library validation was performed using the D1000 ScreenTape Assay kit (Agilent Technologies 5067-5582) on theAgilent TapeStation 4200. Concentration of each library was determined with the NuQuant module of the library prep kit using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen),Libraries were pooled based on equal molar amounts and the multiplexed pool was quantitated, in triplicate, using the Roche Lightcycler96 withFastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche 06402712001) and KAPA Library Quant (Illumina) DNA Standards 1-6 (KAPA Biosystems KK4903). Using the qPCR results, theRNA-Seq library pool was adjusted to 2.125nM for multiplexed sequencing.Pooled libraries were denatured with 0.2N NaOH (0.04N final concentration) and neutralized with 400mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. A dilution of the pooled libraries to 425 pM is performed in the sample tube, on instrument, followed by onboard clonal clustering of the patterned flow cell using the NovaSeq 6000 S1 Reagent Kit (200 cycle) (Illumina 20012864). A 2x101 cycle sequencing profile with dual index reads is completed using the following sequence profile: Read 1 – 101 cycles x Index Read 1 – 8 cycles x Index Read 2 – 8 cycles x Read 2 – 101 cycles. Following collection, sequence data is converted from .bcl file format to fastq file format using bcl2fastq software and de-multiplexed into individual sequences for data distribution using a secure FTP site or Illumina BaseSpace for further downstream analysis.

Control shRNA lentiviral transduction and puromycin selection
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery was used as a tool to test the biological roles for TFAP2C, EPAS1, SNAI1, DLX5, and DLX6 in human TS cells. Several shRNAs designed for each target were subcloned into pLKO.1 and their efficacy tested by RT-qPCR and western blotting. An shRNA which does not recognize any known mammalian gene, pLKO.1-shSCR (Plasmid 1864) was used as a control (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Construct design, lentivirus production, and lentiviral transduction were performed as previously described (Varberg et al. 2021).

ChIP was performed on a hTSC line,TSCT-1 (CT27), established in our previous study (Okae et al. Cell Stem Cell 2018) using the ChIP Reagents (NIPPON GENE).
The ChIP-seq library was constructed using the Ovation Ultralow System V2 (NuGEN) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina).
The puromycin resistant gene (PuroR) and Cas9 were PCR amplified from the pGIPZ vector (Open Biosystems) and Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Expression Plasmid (IDT), respectively. PuroR, a T2A element, and Cas9 were cloned into the CS-CA-MCS plasmid (kindly provided by H. Miyoshi, RIKEN BioResource Center, Ibaraki, Japan) using the In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Takara). The resulting vector was designated as pCS-CA-PuroR-T2A-Cas9. The kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene and the pUC origin were amplified from pCAG-HIVgp (kindly provided by H. Miyoshi), and the human U6 (hU6) promoter was amplified from the pCS-hU6 vector2. The kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene, the pUC origin, the hU6 promoter, 3xFLAG, and a loxP sequence were assembled using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit (NEB). An sgRNA targeting the last exon of SNAI1 (target sequence: 5′-CAC CAA GAG TCC GGC TGC TC-3′), a loxP sequence, and a gRNA target sequence (5′-CCC GAG CAG CCG GAC TCT TGG TG-3′; the PAM sequence is underlined), were inserted between the hU6 promoter and 3xFLAG to generate pU6-sgSNAI1-loxP-FLAG-loxP. The Cre recombinase gene was amplified from the Cre Vector (Santa Cruz) and cloned into the pCS-3G vector2 to generate pCS-3G-Cre. Sequences of the primers used for the vector construction are shown in Supplemental Table. pCS-CA-PuroR-T2A-Cas9 was cotransfected with pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev and pCAG-HIVgp (kindly provided by H. Miyoshi) into 293T cells and lentivirus expressing PuroR-T2A-Cas9 was prepared. The lentivirus was transduced into TSCT-1 cells, and Cas9-expressing cells were selected by 2 mg/ml puromycin for two days. The pU6-sgSNAI1-loxP-FLAG-loxP vector was transfected into the Cas9-expressing TSCT-1 cells using an electroporator (CUY21Vitro-EX; BEX) with the following setting: Poration pulse [125 V, 10 ms]; Driving pulse [20 V, 50 ms, 5 pulses]. After 200 mg/ml G418 selection for 5 days, lentivirus expressing Cre was transduced into the cells to delete the kanamycin/neomycin resistant gene, the hU6 promoter, and the sgRNA sequence. Then, single-cell cloning was performed, and clones with an in-frame insertion of 3xFLAG were identified by Sanger sequencing. This knock-in strategy is based on homology-independent targeted integration3. One of the obtained clones had a homozygous in-frame insertion of 3xFLAG (Supplemental Figure) and was used for ChIP-seq.
ChIP was performed on the clone with 3xFLAG-tagged SNAI1 using the ChIP Reagents (NIPPON GENE) and an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, Clone #M2). Immunoprecipitation was carried out in IP buffer containing 400 mM NaCl instead of 150 mM to reduce the background signal. The sequencing adapters were a mixture of two adapters (Adapter-T and Adapter-C) in equal amounts4. Adapter-T with a 3’-T overhang was prepared by annealing (5’-CTA CAC GAC GCT CTT CCG ATC TT-3’) and (5’-AGA TCG GAA GAG CAC ACG TCT GAA-3’; 5’ phosphorylated). Adapter-C with a 3’-C overhang was prepared by annealing (5’- CTA CAC GAC GCT CTT CCG ATC TC-3’) and (5’-AGA TCG GAA GAG CAC ACG TCT GAA-3’; 5’ phosphorylated). Adapter-C was added to increase the ligation efficiency. The ChIP-seq library was constructed using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina).

ChIP was performed on a hTSC line,TSCT-1 (CT27), established in our previous study (Okae et al. Cell Stem Cell 2018) using the ChIP Reagents (NIPPON GENE).
The ChIP-seq library was constructed using the Ovation Ultralow System V2 (NuGEN) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina).
The puromycin resistant gene (PuroR) and Cas9 were PCR amplified from the pGIPZ vector (Open Biosystems) and Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Expression Plasmid (IDT), respectively. PuroR, a T2A element, and Cas9 were cloned into the CS-CA-MCS plasmid (kindly provided by H. Miyoshi, RIKEN BioResource Center, Ibaraki, Japan) using the In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Takara). The resulting vector was designated as pCS-CA-PuroR-T2A-Cas9. The kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene and the pUC origin were amplified from pCAG-HIVgp (kindly provided by H. Miyoshi), and the human U6 (hU6) promoter was amplified from the pCS-hU6 vector2. The kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene, the pUC origin, the hU6 promoter, 3xFLAG, and a loxP sequence were assembled using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit (NEB). An sgRNA targeting the last exon of SNAI1 (target sequence: 5′-CAC CAA GAG TCC GGC TGC TC-3′), a loxP sequence, and a gRNA target sequence (5′-CCC GAG CAG CCG GAC TCT TGG TG-3′; the PAM sequence is underlined), were inserted between the hU6 promoter and 3xFLAG to generate pU6-sgSNAI1-loxP-FLAG-loxP. The Cre recombinase gene was amplified from the Cre Vector (Santa Cruz) and cloned into the pCS-3G vector2 to generate pCS-3G-Cre. Sequences of the primers used for the vector construction are shown in Supplemental Table. pCS-CA-PuroR-T2A-Cas9 was cotransfected with pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev and pCAG-HIVgp (kindly provided by H. Miyoshi) into 293T cells and lentivirus expressing PuroR-T2A-Cas9 was prepared. The lentivirus was transduced into TSCT-1 cells, and Cas9-expressing cells were selected by 2 mg/ml puromycin for two days. The pU6-sgSNAI1-loxP-FLAG-loxP vector was transfected into the Cas9-expressing TSCT-1 cells using an electroporator (CUY21Vitro-EX; BEX) with the following setting: Poration pulse [125 V, 10 ms]; Driving pulse [20 V, 50 ms, 5 pulses]. After 200 mg/ml G418 selection for 5 days, lentivirus expressing Cre was transduced into the cells to delete the kanamycin/neomycin resistant gene, the hU6 promoter, and the sgRNA sequence. Then, single-cell cloning was performed, and clones with an in-frame insertion of 3xFLAG were identified by Sanger sequencing. This knock-in strategy is based on homology-independent targeted integration3. One of the obtained clones had a homozygous in-frame insertion of 3xFLAG (Supplemental Figure) and was used for ChIP-seq.
ChIP was performed on the clone with 3xFLAG-tagged SNAI1 using the ChIP Reagents (NIPPON GENE) and an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, Clone #M2). Immunoprecipitation was carried out in IP buffer containing 400 mM NaCl instead of 150 mM to reduce the background signal. The sequencing adapters were a mixture of two adapters (Adapter-T and Adapter-C) in equal amounts4. Adapter-T with a 3’-T overhang was prepared by annealing (5’-CTA CAC GAC GCT CTT CCG ATC TT-3’) and (5’-AGA TCG GAA GAG CAC ACG TCT GAA-3’; 5’ phosphorylated). Adapter-C with a 3’-C overhang was prepared by annealing (5’- CTA CAC GAC GCT CTT CCG ATC TC-3’) and (5’-AGA TCG GAA GAG CAC ACG TCT GAA-3’; 5’ phosphorylated). Adapter-C was added to increase the ligation efficiency. The ChIP-seq library was constructed using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina).

Adapter-T with a 3’-T overhang was prepared by annealing (5’-CTA CAC GAC GCT CTT CCG ATC TT-3’) and (5’-AGA TCG GAA GAG CAC ACG TCT GAA-3’; 5’ phosphorylated). Adapter-C with a 3’-C overhang was prepared by annealing (5’- CTA CAC GAC GCT CTT CCG ATC TC-3’) and (5’-AGA TCG GAA GAG CAC ACG TCT GAA-3’; 5’ phosphorylated). Adapter-C was added to increase the ligation efficiency. The ChIP-seq library was constructed using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina).

ChIP was performed on CT27 human TS cells in three replicates using the SimpleChiP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-rabbit AP-2 gamma antibody (1:50, 2320, Cell Signaling) was used in the analysis.
In total of 100 ng of fragmented DNA in 25 µL of water was used as input in library preparation. A KAPA HyperPrep Kit (07962347001, Roche) was used for library preparation, following the protocol associated with the kit with the following modifications. During end repair and a-tailing, 35 µL of water was added to the master mix containing 7 µL of end-repair and a-tailing buffer and 3 µL of end-repair and a-tailing enzyme. Forty-five µL of the end-repair and a-tailing master mix was added to each sample and was mixed thoroughly by pipetting. During the adapter ligation step, Illumina TruSeq DNA LT adapters, supplied at 15 µM, were diluted 1:100 in water and 5 µL of diluted adapters were added to the sample. A master mix of 30 µL of ligation buffer and 10 µL of DNA ligase was made and 40 µL of ligation master mix was added to each sample. After adapter ligation, a 0.8x bead clean-up was performed using AMPure XP Beads (A63881, Beckman Coulter) with a 10 min incubation at room temperature to allow the DNA to bind to the beads and a 7 min incubation after two 80% ethanol washes to allow the beads to dry. Once the beads were dry, the beads were resuspended in 25 µL of water and incubated at room temperature for 2 min. Twenty µL of post-ligation sample was then transferred to a new tube to be used in library amplification. The PCR library amplification master mix consisted of 25 µL of 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, 1.5 µL of 10x PCR primer cocktail, and 3.5 µL of water. Thirty µL of the PCR master mix was added to each post-ligation sample and 13 cycles of PCR were performed. After library amplification, the library underwent a 0.6/0.8x double-sized size selection with 10 min incubations to allow the library to bind to the beads. Two 80% ethanol washes were performed, and the beads were allowed to dry at room temperature for 2 min. Thirty-six µL of water was added to the dried beads and was incubated at room temperature for 2 min to elute the DNA.

Forty-five µL of the end-repair and a-tailing master mix was added to each sample and was mixed thoroughly by pipetting. During the adapter ligation step, Illumina TruSeq DNA LT adapters, supplied at 15 µM, were diluted 1:100 in water and 5 µL of diluted adapters were added to the sample. A master mix of 30 µL of ligation buffer and 10 µL of DNA ligase was made and 40 µL of ligation master mix was added to each sample. After adapter ligation, a 0.8x bead clean-up was performed using AMPure XP Beads (A63881, Beckman Coulter) with a 10 min incubation at room temperature to allow the DNA to bind to the beads and a 7 min incubation after two 80% ethanol washes to allow the beads to dry. Once the beads were dry, the beads were resuspended in 25 µL of water and incubated at room temperature for 2 min. Twenty µL of post-ligation sample was then transferred to a new tube to be used in library amplification. The PCR library amplification master mix consisted of 25 µL of 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, 1.5 µL of 10x PCR primer cocktail, and 3.5 µL of water. Thirty µL of the PCR master mix was added to each post-ligation sample and 13 cycles of PCR were performed. After library amplification, the library underwent a 0.6/0.8x double-sized size selection with 10 min incubations to allow the library to bind to the beads. Two 80% ethanol washes were performed, and the beads were allowed to dry at room temperature for 2 min. Thirty-six µL of water was added to the dried beads and was incubated at room temperature for 2 min to elute the DNA.

ChIP was performed on CT27 human TS cells in three replicates using the SimpleChiP Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-rabbit AP-2 gamma antibody (1:50, 2320, Cell Signaling) was used in the analysis.
In total of 100 ng of fragmented DNA in 25 µL of water was used as input in library preparation. A KAPA HyperPrep Kit (07962347001, Roche) was used for library preparation, following the protocol associated with the kit with the following modifications. During end repair and a-tailing, 35 µL of water was added to the master mix containing 7 µL of end-repair and a-tailing buffer and 3 µL of end-repair and a-tailing enzyme. Forty-five µL of the end-repair and a-tailing master mix was added to each sample and was mixed thoroughly by pipetting. During the adapter ligation step, Illumina TruSeq DNA LT adapters, supplied at 15 µM, were diluted 1:100 in water and 5 µL of diluted adapters were added to the sample.

Human TS cells (Okae et al. 2018) were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (CB40233, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

Cells were rinsed with 5 mL of PBS and then 5 mL PBS containing 2% formaldehyde were added and incubated for 10 min. Then, 550 μL of glycine 1.25 M (final conc 0.125M) were added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature before an additional 15 min incubation on ice. Liquid was removed and cells were rinsed two times with 5 mL ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped and transferred into 2 mL low bind tubes to have the equivalent of 1*10^6 cells (1 Petri Dish). Nuclei were pelleted at 2,500 rpm for 10 min at 4˚C (repeat if necessary) and all supernatant was removed, and flash frozen on dry ice and stored at -80˚C until ready for use. Crosslinked samples were thawed on ice and prepared for Hi-C using the Arima-HiC kit (Arima Genomics, San Diego, CA). Cross-linking was performed according to the Arima-HiC protocol with the following modifications. At step 5, the incubation at 37°C was increased to a duration of 60 min and the samples were maintained overnight at 4°C after step 11. Samples were then cleaned with AMPure XP Beads as described in the protocol and all quantification and quality control steps that required the use of a Qubit were performed using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit. Proximally ligated DNA (1000 ng/sample) was used as an input into the library preparation protocol. Samples were sheared to 400 bp using a Covaris LE220-plus system using the manufacturer’s recommended settings. Sizing was confirmed using a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer kit. Size-selection as described in the Arima-HiC protocol was followed and the entire size-selected sample was used as input into biotin enrichment and library preparation with a KAPA HyperPrep kit and Roche SeqCap Adapters (7141530001 or 7141548001, Roche). Instead of performing the Arima-HiC quality control step 2, the number of cycles needed for library amplification was determined as follows: perform 10 PCR cycles for 125-200 ng of input, perform 9 PCR cycles for 200-400 ng of input, perform 8 PCR cycles for 400-600 ng of input, and perform 7 cycles of PCR for inputs greater than 600 ng. The completed libraries were then quantified using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit and the library size was determined with a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit. Standard Illumina Free-Adapter Blocking was performed on the libraries. Cleaned, adapter-blocked libraries were loaded on a NovaSeq6000 with a run configuration of 151x8x8x151 and an average depth of 900M PE reads per library.

Contact maps for each sample were generated using the Arima Genomics fragment map file specific to GRCh38 and default parameters in Juicer.
After merging contact maps for each cell state, stem and EVT, chromatin loops were discovered with HiCCUPS (Juicer Tools Version 1.22.01) using a matrix size of 1000 (-m 1000) at 5kb, 10 kb, and 25 kb resolution (-r 25000,10000,5000). Differential loops between EVT and stem were identified using HiCCUPSDiff (Juicer Tools Version 1.22.01) with a matrix size of 1000 (-m 1000). The chromatin loops as well as the differential loops were filtered to exclude contacts in the ENCODE blacklisted regions using Bedtools intersect (with option `-v`; Version 2.30.0;74).

Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

Cells were rinsed with 5 mL of PBS and then 5 mL PBS containing 2% formaldehyde were added and incubated for 10 min. Then, 550 μL of glycine 1.25 M (final conc 0.125M) were added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature before an additional 15 min incubation on ice. Liquid was removed and cells were rinsed two times with 5 mL ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped and transferred into 2 mL low bind tubes to have the equivalent of 1*10^6 cells (1 Petri Dish). Nuclei were pelleted at 2,500 rpm for 10 min at 4˚C (repeat if necessary) and all supernatant was removed, and flash frozen on dry ice and stored at -80˚C until ready for use. Crosslinked samples were thawed on ice and prepared for Hi-C using the Arima-HiC kit (Arima Genomics, San Diego, CA). Cross-linking was performed according to the Arima-HiC protocol with the following modifications. At step 5, the incubation at 37°C was increased to a duration of 60 min and the samples were maintained overnight at 4°C after step 11. Samples were then cleaned with AMPure XP Beads as described in the protocol and all quantification and quality control steps that required the use of a Qubit were performed using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit. Proximally ligated DNA (1000 ng/sample) was used as an input into the library preparation protocol. Samples were sheared to 400 bp using a Covaris LE220-plus system using the manufacturer’s recommended settings. Sizing was confirmed using a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer kit. Size-selection as described in the Arima-HiC protocol was followed and the entire size-selected sample was used as input into biotin enrichment and library preparation with a KAPA HyperPrep kit and Roche SeqCap Adapters (7141530001 or 7141548001, Roche). Instead of performing the Arima-HiC quality control step 2, the number of cycles needed for library amplification was determined as follows: perform 10 PCR cycles for 125-200 ng of input, perform 9 PCR cycles for 200-400 ng of input, perform 8 PCR cycles for 400-600 ng of input, and perform 7 cycles of PCR for inputs greater than 600 ng. The completed libraries were then quantified using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit and the library size was determined with a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit. Standard Illumina Free-Adapter Blocking was performed on the libraries. Cleaned, adapter-blocked libraries were loaded on a NovaSeq6000 with a run configuration of 151x8x8x151 and an average depth of 900M PE reads per library.

Contact maps for each sample were generated using the Arima Genomics fragment map file specific to GRCh38 and default parameters in Juicer.
After merging contact maps for each cell state, stem and EVT, chromatin loops were discovered with HiCCUPS (Juicer Tools Version 1.22.01) using a matrix size of 1000 (-m 1000) at 5kb, 10 kb, and 25 kb resolution (-r 25000,10000,5000). Differential loops between EVT and stem were identified using HiCCUPSDiff (Juicer Tools Version 1.22.01) with a matrix size of 1000 (-m 1000). The chromatin loops as well as the differential loops were filtered to exclude contacts in the ENCODE blacklisted regions using Bedtools intersect (with option `-v`; Version 2.30.0;74).

Crosslinked samples were thawed on ice and prepared for Hi-C using the Arima-HiC kit (Arima Genomics, San Diego, CA). Cross-linking was performed according to the Arima-HiC protocol with the following modifications. At step 5, the incubation at 37°C was increased to a duration of 60 min and the samples were maintained overnight at 4°C after step 11. Samples were then cleaned with AMPure XP Beads as described in the protocol and all quantification and quality control steps that required the use of a Qubit were performed using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit. Proximally ligated DNA (1000 ng/sample) was used as an input into the library preparation protocol. Samples were sheared to 400 bp using a Covaris LE220-plus system using the manufacturer’s recommended settings. Sizing was confirmed using a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer kit. Size-selection as described in the Arima-HiC protocol was followed and the entire size-selected sample was used as input into biotin enrichment and library preparation with a KAPA HyperPrep kit and Roche SeqCap Adapters (7141530001 or 7141548001, Roche). Instead of performing the Arima-HiC quality control step 2, the number of cycles needed for library amplification was determined as follows: perform 10 PCR cycles for 125-200 ng of input, perform 9 PCR cycles for 200-400 ng of input, perform 8 PCR cycles for 400-600 ng of input, and perform 7 cycles of PCR for inputs greater than 600 ng. The completed libraries were then quantified using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit and the library size was determined with a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit. Standard Illumina Free-Adapter Blocking was performed on the libraries. Cleaned, adapter-blocked libraries were loaded on a NovaSeq6000 with a run configuration of 151x8x8x151 and an average depth of 900M PE reads per library.

Contact maps for each sample were generated using the Arima Genomics fragment map file specific to GRCh38 and default parameters in Juicer.
After merging contact maps for each cell state, stem and EVT, chromatin loops were discovered with HiCCUPS (Juicer Tools Version 1.22.01) using a matrix size of 1000 (-m 1000) at 5kb, 10 kb, and 25 kb resolution (-r 25000,10000,5000). Differential loops between EVT and stem were identified using HiCCUPSDiff (Juicer Tools Version 1.22.01) with a matrix size of 1000 (-m 1000). The chromatin loops as well as the differential loops were filtered to exclude contacts in the ENCODE blacklisted regions using Bedtools intersect (with option `-v`; Version 2.30.0;74).

Human TS cells (Okae et al. 2018) were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (CB40233, Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Human TS cells were maintained in Complete human TS cell medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid (A8960, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF, E9644, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 μM CHIR99021 (04-0004, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 0.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell), 1 μM SB431542 (04-0010, Reprocell), 0.8 mM valproic acid (P4543, Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μM Y27632 (04-0012-02, Reprocell). EVT cell differentiation was induced by plating human TS cells onto 6-well plates pre-coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV at a density of 80,000 cells per well. Cells were cultured in EVT Differentiation Medium [DMEM/F12 (11320033, Thermo-Fisher), 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (vol/vol) FBS, 50 μM penicillin, 50 U/mL streptomycin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BP9704100, Thermo-Fisher), 1% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine solution (vol/vol, Thermo-Fisher)], 100 ng/mL of neuregulin 1 (NRG1, 5218SC, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), 7.5 μM A83-01 (04-0014, Reprocell, Beltsville, MD), 2.5 μM Y27632 (04-0012, Reprocell), 4% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, 10828028, Thermo-Fisher), and 2% Matrigel® (CB-40234, Thermo-Fisher). On day 3 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and with a reduced Matrigel® concentration of 0.5%. On culture day 6 of EVT cell differentiation, the medium was replaced with EVT Differentiation Medium excluding NRG1 and KSR, and with a Matrigel concentration of 0.5%. Cells were analyzed on day 8 of EVT cell differentiation.

Cells were rinsed with 5 mL of PBS and then 5 mL PBS containing 2% formaldehyde were added and incubated for 10 min. Then, 550 μL of glycine 1.25 M (final conc 0.125M) were added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature before an additional 15 min incubation on ice. Liquid was removed and cells were rinsed two times with 5 mL ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped and transferred into 2 mL low bind tubes to have the equivalent of 1*10^6 cells (1 Petri Dish). Nuclei were pelleted at 2,500 rpm for 10 min at 4˚C (repeat if necessary) and all supernatant was removed, and flash frozen on dry ice and stored at -80˚C until ready for use. Crosslinked samples were thawed on ice and prepared for Hi-C using the Arima-HiC kit (Arima Genomics, San Diego, CA). Cross-linking was performed according to the Arima-HiC protocol with the following modifications. At step 5, the incubation at 37°C was increased to a duration of 60 min and the samples were maintained overnight at 4°C after step 11. Samples were then cleaned with AMPure XP Beads as described in the protocol and all quantification and quality control steps that required the use of a Qubit were performed using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit. Proximally ligated DNA (1000 ng/sample) was used as an input into the library preparation protocol. Samples were sheared to 400 bp using a Covaris LE220-plus system using the manufacturer’s recommended settings. Sizing was confirmed using a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer kit. Size-selection as described in the Arima-HiC protocol was followed and the entire size-selected sample was used as input into biotin enrichment and library preparation with a KAPA HyperPrep kit and Roche SeqCap Adapters (7141530001 or 7141548001, Roche). Instead of performing the Arima-HiC quality control step 2, the number of cycles needed for library amplification was determined as follows: perform 10 PCR cycles for 125-200 ng of input, perform 9 PCR cycles for 200-400 ng of input, perform 8 PCR cycles for 400-600 ng of input, and perform 7 cycles of PCR for inputs greater than 600 ng. The completed libraries were then quantified using a Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit and the library size was determined with a High Sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer Kit. Standard Illumina Free-Adapter Blocking was performed on the libraries. Cleaned, adapter-blocked libraries were loaded on a NovaSeq6000 with a run configuration of 151x8x8x151 and an average depth of 900M PE reads per library.

Contact maps for each sample were generated using the Arima Genomics fragment map file specific to GRCh38 and default parameters in Juicer.
After merging contact maps for each cell state, stem and EVT, chromatin loops were discovered with HiCCUPS (Juicer Tools Version 1.22.01) using a matrix size of 1000 (-m 1000) at 5kb, 10 kb, and 25 kb resolution (-r 25000,10000,5000). Differential loops between EVT and stem were identified using HiCCUPSDiff (Juicer Tools Version 1.22.01) with a matrix size of 1000 (-m 1000). The chromatin loops as well as the differential loops were filtered to exclude contacts in the ENCODE blacklisted regions using Bedtools intersect (with option `-v`; Version 2.30.0;74).
