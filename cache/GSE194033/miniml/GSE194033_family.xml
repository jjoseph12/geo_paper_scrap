    <Pubmed-ID>36411408</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
We conducted an RNA-sequencing on the placentomes that were collected from 4 and 3 cows with and without retained placenta, respectively. Placentomes were collected from the cows within 30 minutes after parturition and samples were taken from the feto-maternal junction sites of the placentomes. These samples were used for RNA-sequencing and the results showed 240 genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups. These genes could be candidate genes that are involved in the development of placental retention in cattle.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Identifying the genes that are differentially expressed in the placentome of cows with or without retained placenta.
