TSC lines CT27 (female) and CT-29 (male) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Engineering Division (https://cell.brc.riken.jp/en/) and cultured as previously described (Okae). In brief, stem-state CTB cells were plated on plates pre-coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (Corning, cat # 354277) and maintained in stem state medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, FisherSci, BP9704100), 1X insulin, transferrin, selenium- ethanolamine supplement ( ITS-X, ThermoFisher, cat # 51500056), 0.2 % v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher, cat # 16141061), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid, 0.8 mM valproic acid, 5 μM Y27632 (ReproCell, cat #04-0012), 2 μM CHIR99021 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), 0.5 μM A83-01 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), and 1 μM SB431542 (ReproCell, cat #04-0010). Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 ds in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3% w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 2 μM Forskolin, and 4% v/v Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) with medium changes every other day.  To induce EVTB/MTB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h. The trophoblast phenotype was initiated using an established protocol (Amita). Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. ClusterProfiler was used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways in R.

Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h. The trophoblast phenotype was initiated using an established protocol (Amita). Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. ClusterProfiler was used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways in R.

Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate.

In brief, stem-state CTB cells were plated on plates pre-coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (Corning, cat # 354277) and maintained in stem state medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, FisherSci, BP9704100), 1X insulin, transferrin, selenium- ethanolamine supplement ( ITS-X, ThermoFisher, cat # 51500056), 0.2 % v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher, cat # 16141061), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid, 0.8 mM valproic acid, 5 μM Y27632 (ReproCell, cat #04-0012), 2 μM CHIR99021 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), 0.5 μM A83-01 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), and 1 μM SB431542 (ReproCell, cat #04-0010). Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 ds in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3% w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 2 μM Forskolin, and 4% v/v Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) with medium changes every other day.  To induce EVTB/MTB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h. The trophoblast phenotype was initiated using an established protocol (Amita). Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. ClusterProfiler was used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways in R.

TSC lines CT27 (female) and CT-29 (male) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Engineering Division (https://cell.brc.riken.jp/en/) and cultured as previously described (Okae). In brief, stem-state CTB cells were plated on plates pre-coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (Corning, cat # 354277) and maintained in stem state medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, FisherSci, BP9704100), 1X insulin, transferrin, selenium- ethanolamine supplement ( ITS-X, ThermoFisher, cat # 51500056), 0.2 % v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher, cat # 16141061), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid, 0.8 mM valproic acid, 5 μM Y27632 (ReproCell, cat #04-0012), 2 μM CHIR99021 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), 0.5 μM A83-01 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), and 1 μM SB431542 (ReproCell, cat #04-0010). Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 ds in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3% w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 2 μM Forskolin, and 4% v/v Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) with medium changes every other day.  To induce EVTB/MTB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h. The trophoblast phenotype was initiated using an established protocol (Amita). Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. ClusterProfiler was used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways in R.

TSC lines CT27 (female) and CT-29 (male) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Engineering Division (https://cell.brc.riken.jp/en/) and cultured as previously described (Okae). In brief, stem-state CTB cells were plated on plates pre-coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (Corning, cat # 354277) and maintained in stem state medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, FisherSci, BP9704100), 1X insulin, transferrin, selenium- ethanolamine supplement ( ITS-X, ThermoFisher, cat # 51500056), 0.2 % v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher, cat # 16141061), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid, 0.8 mM valproic acid, 5 μM Y27632 (ReproCell, cat #04-0012), 2 μM CHIR99021 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), 0.5 μM A83-01 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), and 1 μM SB431542 (ReproCell, cat #04-0010). Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 ds in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3% w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 2 μM Forskolin, and 4% v/v Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) with medium changes every other day.  To induce EVTB/MTB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h. The trophoblast phenotype was initiated using an established protocol (Amita). Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. ClusterProfiler was used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways in R.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. ClusterProfiler was used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways in R.

TSC lines CT27 (female) and CT-29 (male) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Engineering Division (https://cell.brc.riken.jp/en/) and cultured as previously described (Okae). In brief, stem-state CTB cells were plated on plates pre-coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (Corning, cat # 354277) and maintained in stem state medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, FisherSci, BP9704100), 1X insulin, transferrin, selenium- ethanolamine supplement ( ITS-X, ThermoFisher, cat # 51500056), 0.2 % v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher, cat # 16141061), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid, 0.8 mM valproic acid, 5 μM Y27632 (ReproCell, cat #04-0012), 2 μM CHIR99021 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), 0.5 μM A83-01 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), and 1 μM SB431542 (ReproCell, cat #04-0010). Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 ds in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3% w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 2 μM Forskolin, and 4% v/v Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) with medium changes every other day.  To induce EVTB/MTB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h. The trophoblast phenotype was initiated using an established protocol (Amita). Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. ClusterProfiler was used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways in R.

TSC lines CT27 (female) and CT-29 (male) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Engineering Division (https://cell.brc.riken.jp/en/) and cultured as previously described (Okae). In brief, stem-state CTB cells were plated on plates pre-coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (Corning, cat # 354277) and maintained in stem state medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, FisherSci, BP9704100), 1X insulin, transferrin, selenium- ethanolamine supplement ( ITS-X, ThermoFisher, cat # 51500056), 0.2 % v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher, cat # 16141061), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid, 0.8 mM valproic acid, 5 μM Y27632 (ReproCell, cat #04-0012), 2 μM CHIR99021 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), 0.5 μM A83-01 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), and 1 μM SB431542 (ReproCell, cat #04-0010). Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 ds in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3% w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 2 μM Forskolin, and 4% v/v Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) with medium changes every other day.  To induce EVTB/MTB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h.

Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h. The trophoblast phenotype was initiated using an established protocol (Amita). Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2.

Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate.

In brief, stem-state CTB cells were plated on plates pre-coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (Corning, cat # 354277) and maintained in stem state medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, FisherSci, BP9704100), 1X insulin, transferrin, selenium- ethanolamine supplement ( ITS-X, ThermoFisher, cat # 51500056), 0.2 % v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher, cat # 16141061), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid, 0.8 mM valproic acid, 5 μM Y27632 (ReproCell, cat #04-0012), 2 μM CHIR99021 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), 0.5 μM A83-01 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), and 1 μM SB431542 (ReproCell, cat #04-0010). Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 ds in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3% w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 2 μM Forskolin, and 4% v/v Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) with medium changes every other day.  To induce EVTB/MTB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h. The trophoblast phenotype was initiated using an established protocol (Amita). Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. ClusterProfiler was used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways in R.

TSC lines CT27 (female) and CT-29 (male) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Engineering Division (https://cell.brc.riken.jp/en/) and cultured as previously described (Okae). In brief, stem-state CTB cells were plated on plates pre-coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (Corning, cat # 354277) and maintained in stem state medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, FisherSci, BP9704100), 1X insulin, transferrin, selenium- ethanolamine supplement ( ITS-X, ThermoFisher, cat # 51500056), 0.2 % v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher, cat # 16141061), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid, 0.8 mM valproic acid, 5 μM Y27632 (ReproCell, cat #04-0012), 2 μM CHIR99021 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), 0.5 μM A83-01 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), and 1 μM SB431542 (ReproCell, cat #04-0010). Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 ds in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3% w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 2 μM Forskolin, and 4% v/v Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) with medium changes every other day.  To induce EVTB/MTB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h. The trophoblast phenotype was initiated using an established protocol (Amita). Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. ClusterProfiler was used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways in R.

TSC lines CT27 (female) and CT-29 (male) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Engineering Division (https://cell.brc.riken.jp/en/) and cultured as previously described (Okae). In brief, stem-state CTB cells were plated on plates pre-coated with 5 μg/mL collagen IV (Corning, cat # 354277) and maintained in stem state medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA, FisherSci, BP9704100), 1X insulin, transferrin, selenium- ethanolamine supplement ( ITS-X, ThermoFisher, cat # 51500056), 0.2 % v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher, cat # 16141061), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1.5 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid, 0.8 mM valproic acid, 5 μM Y27632 (ReproCell, cat #04-0012), 2 μM CHIR99021 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), 0.5 μM A83-01 (ReproCell, cat #04-0004), and 1 μM SB431542 (ReproCell, cat #04-0010). Monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dispersed to single cells with TrypLE Express for approximately 15 min, and passaged at 75% confluence. Undifferentiated TSC were collected for as CTB for downstream analysis.  To induce STB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 2.5 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 ds in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3% w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 2 μM Forskolin, and 4% v/v Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) with medium changes every other day.  To induce EVTB/MTB differentiation in TSC, cells were passaged to a plate coated with 1 μg/mL collagen IV and seeded at 1 x 105 cells per 35 mm well of a 6 well plate. Cells were differentiated over the course of 6 d in medium containing DMEM/F12 with 0.3 % w/v BSA, 1X ITS-X, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μM Y27632, 7.5 μM A83-01, 100 ng/mL NRG1, 2% Matrigel, and 4 % v/v KSR with medium changes every other day. On d 3 of differentiation, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1. On d 6, medium was exchanged with the above recipe without NRG1 and KSR and cells were passaged a final time to enhance EVTB differentiation.   Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines H1 (WA01, male, XY) and H9 (WA09, female, XX) were obtained from the WiCell Research in Madison, WI (Thomson et al.) Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated 6-well plates in mTESR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then cultured in basal DMEM/F12 with 20 % v/v KOSR, non-essential amino acids, 2mM L-glutamine, and FGF2 (4 ng/mL)  for 24 h. The trophoblast phenotype was initiated using an established protocol (Amita). Medium was exchanged with the same recipe without FGF2, and additional supplementation of BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 µm), and PD173074 (0.1 µm) (BAP) each day over the course of 8 days. Upon completion of BAP treatment, cells were dispersed and passed through a cell strainer to separate small, CTB-like cells (&lt;40 μm) and large, STB-like cells (&gt;70 μm) (Yabe; {Yabe, 2016 #8777}. After separation, cells were centrifuged and snap frozen for downstream assays. All cell culture was completed at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen.

Multiplexed sequencing reads that passed filters were trimmed to remove low-quality reads and adaptors by TrimGalore (version 0.6.7) (-q 25 --length 20 --max_n 3 --stringency 3). The quality of reads after filtering was assessed by fastQC, followed by alignment to the mouse genome (GRCh38) by HISAT2 (version 2.2.1) with default parameters. The output SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using SAMtools6 (version 1.14). Read counts of all samples were quantified by using FeatureCount (Version 2.0.1) with mouse genome as a reference and were adjusted to provide CPM (Counts per million mapped reads). Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were performed by using R (a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified by using edgeR in R. The genes were considered differentially expressed if they provided a false discovery rate of &lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. ClusterProfiler was used to reveal the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways in R.

    <Summary>
The mechanisms controlling trophoblast proliferation and differentiation during embryo implantation are fundamentally important in defining a successful pregnancy, yet poorly understood. Human trophoblast stem cells (TSC) and BMP4/A83-01/PD17034-treated pluripotent stem cell derived trophoblast cells (BAP) are two widely employed, contemporary models to study trophoblast development and function but how faithfully they mimic the identity of early stage trophoblast cells has not been fully examined. Here, we evaluate the transcriptomic profiles of trophoblast cells from these two widely used cell models and directly compare them with trophoblast cells from peri-implantation stage human embryos during extended embryo culture (EEC) between embryonic d 8 to d 12. Cells from BAP and TSC models all grouped closely with trophoblast cells from EEC, with the trophoblast sublineages, including cytotrophoblast (CTB), syncytiotrophoblast (STB), and extravillous-like migratory trophoblast (MTB), clustered together following dimensional analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering. However, subtle differences amongst models exist for each trophoblast sublineages. TSC-CTB is more similar to EEC-CTB from d 8 embryos with transcripts associated with increased Wnt signaling activities important for trophoblast stemness. BAP-CTB are more similar to EEC-CTB from d 10 and 12 embryos and upregulate transcripts important for trophoblast differentiation and invasion. For STB, EEC-STB showed enriched GO terms related to oxygen-dependent metabolism, while BAP and TSC-derived STB both prioritize lipid and membrane synthesis as well as actin reorganization and cell spreading. EEC-MTB transcripts indicate an increased level of invasiveness and motility compared to TSC-MTB with increased proliferative capacity. We also provide a pool of novel lineage markers in early trophoblast that were upregulated (&gt;4-fold) across all three models and validate the presence of 11 proteins prominent in peri-implantation human embryos. Together, our comprehensive analysis revealed that both commonly used BAP and TSC models resemble features of peri-implantation trophoblasts, while still maintaining subtle transcriptomic differences in sublineages.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
We collected human TSC and TSC derived STB and EVT, as well as hESC derived trophoblast cells (separated by cell size, &lt;40um and &gt;70um) by BAP treatment, then total RNA was extracted, followed by RNA-sequencing analysis.
