Placenta samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; five 20-micron sections of each placenta sample were subjected to RNA extraction using the RNAstormTM kit (Cell Data Sciences, Fremont, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA was processed for high-throughput sequencing using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, Greenland, NH, USA). Following mRNA generation, fragmentation, and cDNA synthesis, adaptor barcodes were ligated and final cDNA libraries were amplified by PCR and assessed for quality and concentration.

An index of the hg38 reference genome was created and sequences were aligned to this index using the Rsubread package from the Bioconductor suite in R (Vienna, Austria)
The alignment files were subsequently summarized and associated with their respective features and meta-data.  Initial quality control was performed in MultiQC.
Read count extraction and normalization were performed using the Bioconductor suite and DESeq2 package in R

Placenta samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; five 20-micron sections of each placenta sample were subjected to RNA extraction using the RNAstormTM kit (Cell Data Sciences, Fremont, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA was processed for high-throughput sequencing using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, Greenland, NH, USA). Following mRNA generation, fragmentation, and cDNA synthesis, adaptor barcodes were ligated and final cDNA libraries were amplified by PCR and assessed for quality and concentration.

An index of the hg38 reference genome was created and sequences were aligned to this index using the Rsubread package from the Bioconductor suite in R (Vienna, Austria)
The alignment files were subsequently summarized and associated with their respective features and meta-data.  Initial quality control was performed in MultiQC.
Read count extraction and normalization were performed using the Bioconductor suite and DESeq2 package in R

Placenta samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; five 20-micron sections of each placenta sample were subjected to RNA extraction using the RNAstormTM kit (Cell Data Sciences, Fremont, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA was processed for high-throughput sequencing using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, Greenland, NH, USA). Following mRNA generation, fragmentation, and cDNA synthesis, adaptor barcodes were ligated and final cDNA libraries were amplified by PCR and assessed for quality and concentration.

An index of the hg38 reference genome was created and sequences were aligned to this index using the Rsubread package from the Bioconductor suite in R (Vienna, Austria)
The alignment files were subsequently summarized and associated with their respective features and meta-data.  Initial quality control was performed in MultiQC.
Read count extraction and normalization were performed using the Bioconductor suite and DESeq2 package in R

Placenta samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; five 20-micron sections of each placenta sample were subjected to RNA extraction using the RNAstormTM kit (Cell Data Sciences, Fremont, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA was processed for high-throughput sequencing using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, Greenland, NH, USA). Following mRNA generation, fragmentation, and cDNA synthesis, adaptor barcodes were ligated and final cDNA libraries were amplified by PCR and assessed for quality and concentration.

An index of the hg38 reference genome was created and sequences were aligned to this index using the Rsubread package from the Bioconductor suite in R (Vienna, Austria)
The alignment files were subsequently summarized and associated with their respective features and meta-data.  Initial quality control was performed in MultiQC.
Read count extraction and normalization were performed using the Bioconductor suite and DESeq2 package in R

Placenta samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; five 20-micron sections of each placenta sample were subjected to RNA extraction using the RNAstormTM kit (Cell Data Sciences, Fremont, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA was processed for high-throughput sequencing using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, Greenland, NH, USA). Following mRNA generation, fragmentation, and cDNA synthesis, adaptor barcodes were ligated and final cDNA libraries were amplified by PCR and assessed for quality and concentration.

An index of the hg38 reference genome was created and sequences were aligned to this index using the Rsubread package from the Bioconductor suite in R (Vienna, Austria)
The alignment files were subsequently summarized and associated with their respective features and meta-data.  Initial quality control was performed in MultiQC.
Read count extraction and normalization were performed using the Bioconductor suite and DESeq2 package in R

Placenta samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; five 20-micron sections of each placenta sample were subjected to RNA extraction using the RNAstormTM kit (Cell Data Sciences, Fremont, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNA was processed for high-throughput sequencing using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, Greenland, NH, USA). Following mRNA generation, fragmentation, and cDNA synthesis, adaptor barcodes were ligated and final cDNA libraries were amplified by PCR and assessed for quality and concentration.

An index of the hg38 reference genome was created and sequences were aligned to this index using the Rsubread package from the Bioconductor suite in R (Vienna, Austria)
The alignment files were subsequently summarized and associated with their respective features and meta-data.  Initial quality control was performed in MultiQC.
Read count extraction and normalization were performed using the Bioconductor suite and DESeq2 package in R

    <Title>Placental transcriptome analysis of hypertensive pregnancies identifies distinct gene expression profiles of preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE204835</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>37131171</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The pathogenesis of preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension is poorly understood relative to preeclampsia occurring in pregnant people without chronic hypertension. Placental transcriptomes in pregnancies complicated by de novo preeclampsia and superimposed preeclampsia have not been previously compared.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The goal of this study is to investigate the transcriptomes of placentas from different types of hypertensive pregnancies.
We identified pregnant people in the University of Michigan Biorepository for Understanding Maternal and Pediatric Health with hypertensive disorders affecting singleton, euploid gestations (N=36) along with non-hypertensive control subjects (N=12). Subjects were grouped as: (1) normotensive (N=12), (2) chronic hypertensive (N=13), (3) preterm preeclampsia with severe features (N=5), (4) term preeclampsia with severe features (N=11), (5) preterm superimposed preeclampsia (N=3), or (6) term superimposed preeclampsia (N=4). Bulk RNA sequencing of paraffin-embedded placental tissue was performed.
