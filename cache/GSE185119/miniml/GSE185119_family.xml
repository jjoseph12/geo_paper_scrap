    <Title>Gene expression profiling of trophoblastic organoid from the placental villi of intrauterine and tubal ectopic pregnancies</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE185119</Accession>
    <Summary>
The tubal ectopic pregnancy (TEP) is a severe pregnancy complication accounted for 10-15% pregnancy-related deaths owing to the implantation and growth of embryos in fallopian tubes. Placental villi from TEP exhibit significant difference compared with that from intrauterine pregnancy (IP) in total volumes, trophoblast differentiation and intravillous vascularization.  To investigate the difference in expression profiles of placental villi from IP and TEP, placental villi were collected from each phenotype, separated from maternal tissues and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing.  generated a mouse model in which p53 is activated in neural crest cells due to the expression of a mutant p53 protein (p53-25,26) that can bind to and stabilize wild-type p53. Here, we performed gene expression profiling on neural crest cells isolated from these embryos, to identify the transcriptional response to p53 activation during embryogenesis.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
RNA-seq was performed on trophonblastic organoid from pregnant women at 6-8 gestational weeks. Exclusion criteria for all samples are: IP with EP histories, miscarriage, preeclampsia, and preterm delivery. EP with some risk factors associated with fallopian tubal abnormalities, e.g., smoking, obvious tubal inflammatory adhesions, previous fallopian tubal diseases, and tubal surgery histories, were also excluded for avoiding complications. In each case, gestational days was 40-64 days confirmed from the last menstrual period. n=5 for both IP and TEP.
