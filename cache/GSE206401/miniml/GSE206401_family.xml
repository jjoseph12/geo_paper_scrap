RNA was isolated from placental and FM tissues and cell lines using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Using RNA extracted from placental and FM tissues (n=5 per tissue) and cells (n=3 per cell type), a cDNA library was prepared according to the Smart-3SEQ protocol

UMIs were removed from the reads and added to the read name with the extract_umi.py software provided by the Smart-3SEQ authors
Reads were aligned to the human assembly GCA_000001405.15 using STAR version 2.7.5c using the parameters recommended by the software authors for the Encode consortium
The dedup.py Smart-3SEQ software was used to mark and remove duplicated reads
FeatureCounts software was used to count reads per gene using the Gencode annotation release 35
Assembly: GCA_000001405.15
Supplementary files format and content: Tab-separated values files output containing normalized raw counts from edgeR

    <Summary>
This study characterized CYP450 and nutrient transport expression in human fetal membranes.
RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of RNA derived from human placental and fetal membrane tissues and cells was done.
