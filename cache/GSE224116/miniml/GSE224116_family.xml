Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk).

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome.

Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E.

In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome.

Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome.

Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome.

Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver.

Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome.

Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome.

Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E.

In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

Exposure: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E. Coli serotype 00:55 B5 LPS (Sigma Lot nr. 025M4040V)) was diluted to the final concentration (0.02 µg/µl) in double distilled pyrogen-free water (Chem-Lab, Zedelgem, Belgium). In the morning of GD 17, the pregnant mice were divided into control and LPS treatment groups, evenly distributing weights among the groups. Animals were placed in a whole-body inhalation chamber with an attached anaesthetic vaporizer  delivering 3-4% isoflurane in filtered air, and were intratracheally instilled with 50 µl of vehicle (control group) or 1 μg LPS in 50 µl vehicle, followed by 200μl of air. Vehicle and LPS were administered through a 0.58 mm polyethylene tube (Ref: 427411, Becton Dickinson, Brøndby, Denmark) attached to a plastic syringe. After instillation, animals were returned to their cage, briefly placed on heating pads and checked upon regularly until euthanization.

Animals : Nulliparous C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France) from the same barrier were time-mated and pregnancy confirmed by the presence of vaginal plug the morning after mating (designated gestation day (GD) 0). Dams arrived at the institute at GD 11 or 12 and were allowed to acclimate for 6-7 days prior to exposure. Mice were pair housed in clear 1290D euro standard polypropylene cages with Aspen bedding (Tapvei, Estonia), enrichment (mouse house 80-ACRE011, Techniplast, Italy; small aspen blocks, Tapvei, Estonia) and nesting material (Enviro Dri, Lillico, Biotechnology, UK), under controlled conditions and access to food (Altromin 1314 for breeding, Brogaaarden, Denmark) and tap water ad libitum. Animals were weighed on the day of arrival and the day prior to exposure to confirm pregnancy.

Isolation of pups and maternal/fetal organs: At 2, 5, 12 and 24 h, dams were terminally anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml of Zoletil mixture (tiletamin/zolazepam, xylazin og fentanyl) and killed by exanguination by withdrawal of heart blood into Eppendorf tubes containing 36 ml K2EDTA (n=7-9 per exposure/time point). The uterus was excised and opened. Fetuses were excised from their embryonic sac, their viability confirmed, killed by decapitation, sexed by visual inspection, and their position in the uterus noted. From each litter, the first female fetus encountered in the right uterine horn, counting from the cervix, was selected and saved for analyses. The placenta was dissected into chorion and decidua by blunt/stump dissection under. From dams, the liver and right lung were dissected. Dissected organs were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80ºC. Fetal livers were dissected later. Maternal blood was centrifuged at 2000xg at 4°C for 5 min and plasma was stored in aliquots at -80°C until analysis. A maximum of one female fetus from each dam were used for any one outcome. RNA extraction: Total RNA was isolated from frozen maternal lung and liver, chorion, decidua and fetal liver. Briefly, 20 - 50 mg of tissue was homogenized with a blender in 700 ul lysis buffer with 7 ul mercapto-ethanol. RNA extraction was carried out utilizing magnetic beads technology, on a chemagic Prepito® (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts), as recommended by the manufacturer. Concentration and purity were measured on a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer, with all samples showing an A260/280 ratio between 1.9 and 2.1. RNA integrity was analyzed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies) as recommended by manufacturer. All samples used for RNAseq displayed RNA integrity number (RIN) above 7. cDNA library construction and paired end sequencing was carried out by Novogene (Hongkong). To exclude ribosomal RNA, polyA selection was done.

Basecalling done bg Novogene as part of paid service. Sequencing produced a total of 828 libraries (414 paired end), with a median read depth of 24*106 reads (mean 25*106 reads, min 19.9 and max 46.6106), all of which passed initial QC controls performed by multiqc56. We detected base-pair overrepresentation in the first 11 bp of each read, as expected due to biases in random primers, and removed them using the trimfq command from seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). Reads were mapped to gencode mouse transcriptome version M2357, which is an annotation of the genome assembly version GRCm38. In order to perform pseudo-mapping with Salmon58, we created an index using k-mer size 31 bp and supplying the genome in order to create decoy k-mers to account for biases due to un-annotated transcribed genomic regions (as described in Salmon documentation). We mapped libraries to the resulting index using Salmon quant using the following options: gcBias, seqBias, validateMappings, numBootstraps=10 and minScoreFraction=0.8. Finally, we annotated the resulting quant files using the R library tximeta59 and removed all features that lacked annotation. We performed all initial exploratory analyses and plots (e.g. PCA) using TPM-normalized data, and used the raw count data for the differential expression analysis. Before fitting statistical models, we normalised the count data from Salmon using TMM, retained only transcripts with more than 10 reads in at least 70% of the samples of the same condition, and applied voom correction for mean/variance relationship using the limma package60.

    <Title>The placenta has an active role in maintaining fetal homeostasis following maternal immune activation</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE224116</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>38830841</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Activation of the maternal immune system during pregnancy affects fetal development, which can increase in postnatal susceptibility to a range of diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric disorders. During maternal immune activation (MIA), the maternal body must balance its ressources between mounting an immune response and investing resources into continued metabolism and growth, essentials for survival of the fetus and a successful pregnancy. How the placenta responds to MIA over time and how it can protect the fetus is not well understood, and neither are the fetal consequences of MIA. Here, we characterised the response to acute maternal lung inflammation across time in maternal and fetal organs, using a combination of omics, imaging and integrative computational analyses. We found that the placenta, unlike other maternal organs, did not react by a typical innate immune response, but instead induced genes associated with increased tissue integrity,  likely to prevent fetal exposure to potential infections, and simultaneously reduced expression of growth-associated genes. Subsequently, a return to homeostasis was observed, with heightened expression of biosynthesis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes. These responses likely protect the fetus from inflammation, as we observed no immune response in the fetal liver transcriptome. Instead, we observed metabolic adaptations in the fetus, including a release of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) carrying metabolites, including triglyceride and phosphatidylcholine. Notably, DHA is crucial for fetal brain development. This metabolic response is likely a combination of the placental MIA response and temporary maternal fasting, caused by MIA-induced fever and lack of nutrient intake. Our study shows, for the first time, the integrated temporal and systemic response to LPS in lungs across maternal and fetal organs
