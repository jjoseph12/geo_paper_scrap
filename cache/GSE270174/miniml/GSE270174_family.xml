hTSCs were derived as explained in PMID: 34791028, PMID: 3454082.

      <Growth-Protocol>
All tissue samples were processed within 2 hours of sample collection. Tissues were minced and subjected to sequential digestion with Trypsin and DNase, followed by Percoll gradient separation as previously described (PMID: 28167044). For trophoblast stem cell derivation, the CTBs were MACS-purified with with either a PE-conjugated anti-ITGA6 antibody (Biolegend #313612) or an APC-conjugated anti-EGFR antibody (Biolegend #352906).

Single cell suspensions were washed, filtered for cell debris, counted, and stained with a viability marker to ensure correct loading concentration and a high percentage of live cells. Cell suspensions were then loaded onto the 10x Genomics Controller for GEM generation.
Library was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (single cell 3’ v2 protocol, 10x Genomics). Briefly, GCs were resuspended in the master mix and loaded together with partitioning oil and gel beads into the chip to generate the gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM). The poly-A RNA from the cell lysate contained in every single GEM was retrotranscripted to cDNA, which contains an Ilumina R1 primer sequence, Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and the 10x Barcode. The pooled barcoded cDNA was then cleaned up with Silane DynaBeads, amplified by PCR and the apropiated sized fragments were selected with SPRIselect reagent for subsequent library construction. During the library construction Ilumina R2 primer sequence, paired-end constructs with P5 and P7 sequences and a sample index were added.

Data was mapped using the STARsolo function of STAR (v.2.7.10a) (Dobin, 2013). STARsolo performed error correction and demultiplexing of cell barcodes using user-input whitelist (3M-february-2018.txt for version 3 of the 10X Genomics Chromium System and 737K-august-2016.txt for version 2 data), mapped reads to the reference genome (GRCh38, version 32, Ensembl 98), deduplicated and error corrected UMIs, quantified per-cell gene expression, and spliced and unspliced reads similar to Velocyto.

Single cell suspensions were washed, filtered for cell debris, counted, and stained with a viability marker to ensure correct loading concentration and a high percentage of live cells. Cell suspensions were then loaded onto the 10x Genomics Controller for GEM generation.
Library was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (single cell 3’ v2 protocol, 10x Genomics). Briefly, GCs were resuspended in the master mix and loaded together with partitioning oil and gel beads into the chip to generate the gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM). The poly-A RNA from the cell lysate contained in every single GEM was retrotranscripted to cDNA, which contains an Ilumina R1 primer sequence, Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and the 10x Barcode. The pooled barcoded cDNA was then cleaned up with Silane DynaBeads, amplified by PCR and the apropiated sized fragments were selected with SPRIselect reagent for subsequent library construction. During the library construction Ilumina R2 primer sequence, paired-end constructs with P5 and P7 sequences and a sample index were added.

All tissue samples were processed within 2 hours of sample collection. Tissues were minced and subjected to sequential digestion with Trypsin and DNase, followed by Percoll gradient separation as previously described (PMID: 28167044). For trophoblast stem cell derivation, the CTBs were MACS-purified with with either a PE-conjugated anti-ITGA6 antibody (Biolegend #313612) or an APC-conjugated anti-EGFR antibody (Biolegend #352906).

Single cell suspensions were washed, filtered for cell debris, counted, and stained with a viability marker to ensure correct loading concentration and a high percentage of live cells. Cell suspensions were then loaded onto the 10x Genomics Controller for GEM generation.
Library was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (single cell 3’ v2 protocol, 10x Genomics). Briefly, GCs were resuspended in the master mix and loaded together with partitioning oil and gel beads into the chip to generate the gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM). The poly-A RNA from the cell lysate contained in every single GEM was retrotranscripted to cDNA, which contains an Ilumina R1 primer sequence, Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and the 10x Barcode. The pooled barcoded cDNA was then cleaned up with Silane DynaBeads, amplified by PCR and the apropiated sized fragments were selected with SPRIselect reagent for subsequent library construction. During the library construction Ilumina R2 primer sequence, paired-end constructs with P5 and P7 sequences and a sample index were added.

Data was mapped using the STARsolo function of STAR (v.2.7.10a) (Dobin, 2013). STARsolo performed error correction and demultiplexing of cell barcodes using user-input whitelist (3M-february-2018.txt for version 3 of the 10X Genomics Chromium System and 737K-august-2016.txt for version 2 data), mapped reads to the reference genome (GRCh38, version 32, Ensembl 98), deduplicated and error corrected UMIs, quantified per-cell gene expression, and spliced and unspliced reads similar to Velocyto.

Sections were deparaffinized and incubated overnight with the Whole Transcriptomic Assay UV-cleavable biological probes according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were stained with CONFIRM® anti-EGFR (5B7) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody  (Ventana #790-4347, 1:20 dilution) and anti-HLA-G (4H48) mouse primary antibody (Abcam #ab52455, 1:1000 dilution) for 2 hours followed by secondary staining for 1h with Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit-647 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor anti-mouse-594 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), and SYTO13 (Nanostring, 1:10 dilution) for nuclei staining. Slides were scanned on a GeoMx digital spatial profiler machine r. Based on the morphology markers, areas of interest (AOIs) containing at least EGFR+/HLA-G- 100 nuclei were manually selected.
Spatial transcriptomic libraries were prepared with GeoMx reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol - Direct PCR

Sections were deparaffinized and incubated overnight with the Whole Transcriptomic Assay UV-cleavable biological probes according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were stained with CONFIRM® anti-EGFR (5B7) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody  (Ventana #790-4347, 1:20 dilution) and anti-HLA-G (4H48) mouse primary antibody (Abcam #ab52455, 1:1000 dilution) for 2 hours followed by secondary staining for 1h with Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit-647 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor anti-mouse-594 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), and SYTO13 (Nanostring, 1:10 dilution) for nuclei staining. Slides were scanned on a GeoMx digital spatial profiler machine r. Based on the morphology markers, areas of interest (AOIs) containing at least EGFR+/HLA-G- 100 nuclei were manually selected.

Sections were deparaffinized and incubated overnight with the Whole Transcriptomic Assay UV-cleavable biological probes according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were stained with CONFIRM® anti-EGFR (5B7) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody  (Ventana #790-4347, 1:20 dilution) and anti-HLA-G (4H48) mouse primary antibody (Abcam #ab52455, 1:1000 dilution) for 2 hours followed by secondary staining for 1h with Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit-647 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor anti-mouse-594 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), and SYTO13 (Nanostring, 1:10 dilution) for nuclei staining. Slides were scanned on a GeoMx digital spatial profiler machine r. Based on the morphology markers, areas of interest (AOIs) containing at least EGFR+/HLA-G- 100 nuclei were manually selected.
Spatial transcriptomic libraries were prepared with GeoMx reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol - Direct PCR

Sections were deparaffinized and incubated overnight with the Whole Transcriptomic Assay UV-cleavable biological probes according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were stained with CONFIRM® anti-EGFR (5B7) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody  (Ventana #790-4347, 1:20 dilution) and anti-HLA-G (4H48) mouse primary antibody (Abcam #ab52455, 1:1000 dilution) for 2 hours followed by secondary staining for 1h with Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit-647 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor anti-mouse-594 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), and SYTO13 (Nanostring, 1:10 dilution) for nuclei staining. Slides were scanned on a GeoMx digital spatial profiler machine r. Based on the morphology markers, areas of interest (AOIs) containing at least EGFR+/HLA-G- 100 nuclei were manually selected.
Spatial transcriptomic libraries were prepared with GeoMx reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol - Direct PCR

Sections were deparaffinized and incubated overnight with the Whole Transcriptomic Assay UV-cleavable biological probes according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were stained with CONFIRM® anti-EGFR (5B7) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody  (Ventana #790-4347, 1:20 dilution) and anti-HLA-G (4H48) mouse primary antibody (Abcam #ab52455, 1:1000 dilution) for 2 hours followed by secondary staining for 1h with Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit-647 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor anti-mouse-594 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), and SYTO13 (Nanostring, 1:10 dilution) for nuclei staining. Slides were scanned on a GeoMx digital spatial profiler machine r. Based on the morphology markers, areas of interest (AOIs) containing at least EGFR+/HLA-G- 100 nuclei were manually selected.
Spatial transcriptomic libraries were prepared with GeoMx reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol - Direct PCR

Sections were deparaffinized and incubated overnight with the Whole Transcriptomic Assay UV-cleavable biological probes according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were stained with CONFIRM® anti-EGFR (5B7) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody  (Ventana #790-4347, 1:20 dilution) and anti-HLA-G (4H48) mouse primary antibody (Abcam #ab52455, 1:1000 dilution) for 2 hours followed by secondary staining for 1h with Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit-647 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor anti-mouse-594 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), and SYTO13 (Nanostring, 1:10 dilution) for nuclei staining. Slides were scanned on a GeoMx digital spatial profiler machine r. Based on the morphology markers, areas of interest (AOIs) containing at least EGFR+/HLA-G- 100 nuclei were manually selected.
Spatial transcriptomic libraries were prepared with GeoMx reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol - Direct PCR

Sections were deparaffinized and incubated overnight with the Whole Transcriptomic Assay UV-cleavable biological probes according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were stained with CONFIRM® anti-EGFR (5B7) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody  (Ventana #790-4347, 1:20 dilution) and anti-HLA-G (4H48) mouse primary antibody (Abcam #ab52455, 1:1000 dilution) for 2 hours followed by secondary staining for 1h with Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit-647 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor anti-mouse-594 (Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), and SYTO13 (Nanostring, 1:10 dilution) for nuclei staining. Slides were scanned on a GeoMx digital spatial profiler machine r. Based on the morphology markers, areas of interest (AOIs) containing at least EGFR+/HLA-G- 100 nuclei were manually selected.
Spatial transcriptomic libraries were prepared with GeoMx reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol - Direct PCR

All tissue samples were processed within 2 hours of sample collection. Tissues were minced and subjected to sequential digestion with Trypsin and DNase, followed by Percoll gradient separation as previously described (PMID: 28167044). For trophoblast stem cell derivation, the CTBs were MACS-purified with with either a PE-conjugated anti-ITGA6 antibody (Biolegend #313612) or an APC-conjugated anti-EGFR antibody (Biolegend #352906). MACS-purified CTB were then plated for TSC derivation as previously described (PMID: 34540826 and PMID: 37164912 ) and cultured with modified TSC media (PMID: 34454392). Cells were collected at specified time points.

Single cell suspensions were washed, filtered for cell debris, counted, and stained with a viability marker to ensure correct loading concentration and a high percentage of live cells. Cell suspensions were then loaded onto the 10x Genomics Controller for GEM generation.
Library was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (single cell 3’ v2 protocol, 10x Genomics). Briefly, GCs were resuspended in the master mix and loaded together with partitioning oil and gel beads into the chip to generate the gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM). The poly-A RNA from the cell lysate contained in every single GEM was retrotranscripted to cDNA, which contains an Ilumina R1 primer sequence, Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and the 10x Barcode. The pooled barcoded cDNA was then cleaned up with Silane DynaBeads, amplified by PCR and the apropiated sized fragments were selected with SPRIselect reagent for subsequent library construction. During the library construction Ilumina R2 primer sequence, paired-end constructs with P5 and P7 sequences and a sample index were added.

All tissue samples were processed within 2 hours of sample collection. Tissues were minced and subjected to sequential digestion with Trypsin and DNase, followed by Percoll gradient separation as previously described (PMID: 28167044). For trophoblast stem cell derivation, the CTBs were MACS-purified with with either a PE-conjugated anti-ITGA6 antibody (Biolegend #313612) or an APC-conjugated anti-EGFR antibody (Biolegend #352906). MACS-purified CTB were then plated for TSC derivation as previously described (PMID: 34540826 and PMID: 37164912 ) and cultured with modified TSC media (PMID: 34454392). Cells were collected at specified time points.

Single cell suspensions were washed, filtered for cell debris, counted, and stained with a viability marker to ensure correct loading concentration and a high percentage of live cells. Cell suspensions were then loaded onto the 10x Genomics Controller for GEM generation.
Library was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (single cell 3’ v2 protocol, 10x Genomics). Briefly, GCs were resuspended in the master mix and loaded together with partitioning oil and gel beads into the chip to generate the gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM). The poly-A RNA from the cell lysate contained in every single GEM was retrotranscripted to cDNA, which contains an Ilumina R1 primer sequence, Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and the 10x Barcode. The pooled barcoded cDNA was then cleaned up with Silane DynaBeads, amplified by PCR and the apropiated sized fragments were selected with SPRIselect reagent for subsequent library construction. During the library construction Ilumina R2 primer sequence, paired-end constructs with P5 and P7 sequences and a sample index were added.

All tissue samples were processed within 2 hours of sample collection. Tissues were minced and subjected to sequential digestion with Trypsin and DNase, followed by Percoll gradient separation as previously described (PMID: 28167044). For trophoblast stem cell derivation, the CTBs were MACS-purified with with either a PE-conjugated anti-ITGA6 antibody (Biolegend #313612) or an APC-conjugated anti-EGFR antibody (Biolegend #352906). MACS-purified CTB were then plated for TSC derivation as previously described (PMID: 34540826 and PMID: 37164912 ) and cultured with modified TSC media (PMID: 34454392). Cells were collected at specified time points.

Single cell suspensions were washed, filtered for cell debris, counted, and stained with a viability marker to ensure correct loading concentration and a high percentage of live cells. Cell suspensions were then loaded onto the 10x Genomics Controller for GEM generation.
Library was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (single cell 3’ v2 protocol, 10x Genomics). Briefly, GCs were resuspended in the master mix and loaded together with partitioning oil and gel beads into the chip to generate the gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM). The poly-A RNA from the cell lysate contained in every single GEM was retrotranscripted to cDNA, which contains an Ilumina R1 primer sequence, Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and the 10x Barcode. The pooled barcoded cDNA was then cleaned up with Silane DynaBeads, amplified by PCR and the apropiated sized fragments were selected with SPRIselect reagent for subsequent library construction. During the library construction Ilumina R2 primer sequence, paired-end constructs with P5 and P7 sequences and a sample index were added.

Data was mapped using the STARsolo function of STAR (v.2.7.10a) (Dobin, 2013). STARsolo performed error correction and demultiplexing of cell barcodes using user-input whitelist (3M-3pgex-may-2023.txt for version 4), mapped reads to the reference genome (GRCh38, version 32, Ensembl 98), deduplicated and error corrected UMIs, quantified per-cell gene expression, and spliced and unspliced reads similar to Velocyto.
