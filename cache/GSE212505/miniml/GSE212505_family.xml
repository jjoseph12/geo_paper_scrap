The placenta biopsies was mechanically disassociated and enzymatically digested by incubating in digestion media of 2.5% trypsin, 300 U/mL collagenase, and 200 ug/mL DNAse in PBS for 90 minutes at 37oC in 5% CO2. Red blood cell lysis buffer was added to eliminate red blood cells. The cells were strained through a 100uM nylon mesh strainer. The cells were frozen for later use. At time of processing, the frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in an ideal cell concentration of 700-1200 cells/uL for single-cell sequencing.
scRNA-seq libraries were generated using 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v3. Cells were loaded accordingly following the 10X Genomics protocol with an estimated targeted cell recovery of 6000 cells.

    <Data-Processing>
Sequencing was performed on NovaSeq 6000 (Pair-end, 100 base pairs per read).
The digital expression matrix was generated by demultiplexing, barcode processing, and gene unique molecular index counting using the Cellranger count pipeline (version 4.0.0, 10X Genomics).
Multiple samples were merged using the Cellranger aggr pipeline.

The placenta biopsies was mechanically disassociated and enzymatically digested by incubating in digestion media of 2.5% trypsin, 300 U/mL collagenase, and 200 ug/mL DNAse in PBS for 90 minutes at 37oC in 5% CO2. Red blood cell lysis buffer was added to eliminate red blood cells. The cells were strained through a 100uM nylon mesh strainer. The cells were frozen for later use. At time of processing, the frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in an ideal cell concentration of 700-1200 cells/uL for single-cell sequencing.
scRNA-seq libraries were generated using 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v3. Cells were loaded accordingly following the 10X Genomics protocol with an estimated targeted cell recovery of 6000 cells.

    <Description>
one merged expression matrix for all samples
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Sequencing was performed on NovaSeq 6000 (Pair-end, 100 base pairs per read).
The digital expression matrix was generated by demultiplexing, barcode processing, and gene unique molecular index counting using the Cellranger count pipeline (version 4.0.0, 10X Genomics).
Multiple samples were merged using the Cellranger aggr pipeline.

    <Summary>
This study utilizes advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing to generate transcriptomes from placenta accreta and control specimens.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
For each of 3 accreta placentas, a biopsy was taken at the site of deepest invasion, AI (accreta invasive), and a site opposite of AI in the same placenta where it was attached normally, AO (accreta opposite). AI and AO from three accreta participants were compared to placental biopsies from three control (C) participants.
