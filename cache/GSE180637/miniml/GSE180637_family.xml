    <Title>A single-cell transcriptome landscape of the non-human primate placenta across pregnancy.</Title>

    <Summary>
The human placenta, a transient endocrine organ, is vital for successful pregnancy and fetal health, which undergoes dynamic cellular and functional changes during gestation. However, systematic longitudinal analysis of in utero human placenta formation and development across the lifespan is not feasible due to ethical and technical limit. To circumvent those difficulties and reveal the dynamic placentation, we obtain transcriptional snapshots of 217404 single cells from cynomolgus monkey placenta, decidua and embryo tissues spanning ten consecutive but distinct developmental stages across pregnancy. We reveal the development-related changes in the compositions of placental trophoblasts, mesenchymal cells and endothelial cells in different pregnant stage. We pinpoint that the placenta mesenchymal cells are derived from a special extra-embryonic mesoderm. Particularly, we describe the relationship between the embryonic primitive hematopoiesis and the placental endothelial cells, Hofbauer cells and erythrocytes. Besides, we found the cell types and their transcriptome compositions in decidual tissues show insignificant changes during the gestation. Finally, cell-cell interactions between trophoblasts and decidual cells, and between different cell types on villi are performed and suggested the mechanisms in dynamic placentation. Together, the high-resolution atlas we constructed would serve as a valuable resource to extrapolate key events for studies on human placentation and its associated disorders.
