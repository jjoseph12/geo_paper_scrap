Total RNA fom peripheral blood samples (mothers, newborns) were extracted using the Ribopure blood kit and eluted in the kit's elution solution with post extraction dnase treatment. Total RNA from placentas were extracted using a trizol and Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol and eluted in H2O with on-column dnase treatment.

Total RNA fom peripheral blood samples (mothers, newborns) were extracted using the Ribopure blood kit and eluted in the kit's elution solution with post extraction dnase treatment. Total RNA from placentas were extracted using a trizol and Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol and eluted in H2O with on-column dnase treatment.

Total RNA fom peripheral blood samples (mothers, newborns) were extracted using the Ribopure blood kit and eluted in the kit's elution solution with post extraction dnase treatment. Total RNA from placentas were extracted using a trizol and Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol and eluted in H2O with on-column dnase treatment.

Total RNA fom peripheral blood samples (mothers, newborns) were extracted using the Ribopure blood kit and eluted in the kit's elution solution with post extraction dnase treatment. Total RNA from placentas were extracted using a trizol and Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol and eluted in H2O with on-column dnase treatment.

Total RNA fom peripheral blood samples (mothers, newborns) were extracted using the Ribopure blood kit and eluted in the kit's elution solution with post extraction dnase treatment. Total RNA from placentas were extracted using a trizol and Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol and eluted in H2O with on-column dnase treatment.

Total RNA fom peripheral blood samples (mothers, newborns) were extracted using the Ribopure blood kit and eluted in the kit's elution solution with post extraction dnase treatment. Total RNA from placentas were extracted using a trizol and Qiagen RNeasy kit protocol and eluted in H2O with on-column dnase treatment.

The data were analyzed with Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) 4.0.2 software using the Signal Space Transformation-Robust Multi-chip Analysis (SST-RMA) for adjustment of background noise, normalization, and summarization. The detected above background (DABG) threshold was set to the default 0.05.

    <Title>Expression data from mothers, placentas, and newborns in the Democratic Republic of Congo</Title>

    <Summary>
Maternal stress has long been associated with lower birthweight but mechanisms remain elusive. This study explored how maternal stress may impact changes in gene expression within a cohort of mother-placenta-newborn triads in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the impact of maternal stress on newborn birthweight and identified that global placental gene expression may partially mediate the negative impact of maternal war stress on newborn birthweight.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Samples from Homo sapiens sapiens mother, newborn, and placenta triads were collected at the time of birth for RNA extraction and hybridization on the Human Clariom D microarray (Affymetrix GeneChip system).
