Pregnant Nlrp3+/+ and Nlrp3-/- dams were intra-amniotically injected with S100B or PBS on 16.5 days post coitum. Sixteen hours after the injection, the decidual and uterine tissues were collected, followed by the isolation of neutrophils and macrophages from these tissues using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Total RNA was extracted from the sorted cells using the Pico Pure RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations, purity, and integrity were evaluated using the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and the Bioanalyzer 2100. Two to four biological replicates from each group were combined for the neutrophil samples to obtain quantities of RNA for RNA-seq. cDNA was synthetized using Smart-seq2.
The Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit were used to prepare the RNA-seq library according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Sixteen hours after the injection, the decidual and uterine tissues were collected, followed by the isolation of neutrophils and macrophages from these tissues using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Total RNA was extracted from the sorted cells using the Pico Pure RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations, purity, and integrity were evaluated using the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and the Bioanalyzer 2100. Two to four biological replicates from each group were combined for the neutrophil samples to obtain quantities of RNA for RNA-seq. cDNA was synthetized using Smart-seq2.
The Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit were used to prepare the RNA-seq library according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Pregnant Nlrp3+/+ and Nlrp3-/- dams were intra-amniotically injected with S100B or PBS on 16.5 days post coitum. Sixteen hours after the injection, the decidual and uterine tissues were collected, followed by the isolation of neutrophils and macrophages from these tissues using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Total RNA was extracted from the sorted cells using the Pico Pure RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations, purity, and integrity were evaluated using the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and the Bioanalyzer 2100. Two to four biological replicates from each group were combined for the neutrophil samples to obtain quantities of RNA for RNA-seq. cDNA was synthetized using Smart-seq2.
The Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit were used to prepare the RNA-seq library according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Pregnant Nlrp3+/+ and Nlrp3-/- dams were intra-amniotically injected with S100B or PBS on 16.5 days post coitum. Sixteen hours after the injection, the decidual and uterine tissues were collected, followed by the isolation of neutrophils and macrophages from these tissues using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Total RNA was extracted from the sorted cells using the Pico Pure RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations, purity, and integrity were evaluated using the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and the Bioanalyzer 2100. Two to four biological replicates from each group were combined for the neutrophil samples to obtain quantities of RNA for RNA-seq. cDNA was synthetized using Smart-seq2.
The Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit were used to prepare the RNA-seq library according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Pregnant Nlrp3+/+ and Nlrp3-/- dams were intra-amniotically injected with S100B or PBS on 16.5 days post coitum. Sixteen hours after the injection, the decidual and uterine tissues were collected, followed by the isolation of neutrophils and macrophages from these tissues using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Total RNA was extracted from the sorted cells using the Pico Pure RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations, purity, and integrity were evaluated using the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and the Bioanalyzer 2100. Two to four biological replicates from each group were combined for the neutrophil samples to obtain quantities of RNA for RNA-seq. cDNA was synthetized using Smart-seq2.
The Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit were used to prepare the RNA-seq library according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

    <Title>A key role for NLRP3 signaling in preterm labor and birth driven by the alarmin S100B</Title>

    <Pubmed-ID>37121539</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Decidual and uterine macrophages as well as neutrophils from Nlrp3+/+ and Nlrp3-/- mice injected with S100B or PBS were sorted and analyzed using pair-end BGI RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to evaluate the effect of Nlrp3 deficiency on the transcriptome of these innate immune cells in preterm birth.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The study included Nlrp3+/+ dams intra-amniotically injected with S100B, Nlrp3+/+ dams intra-amniotically injected with PBS, Nlrp3-/- dams intra-amniotically injected with S100B, and Nlrp3-/- dams intra-amniotically injected with PBS. Decidual and uterine macrophages and neutrophils were sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorting. The number of samples analyzed were as follows: Macrophages, n = 3 each, Neutrophils, n = 2 each.
